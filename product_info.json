        "Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs have been a game-changer in my daily comfort and wearability. As someone who prioritizes both quality and comfort in underwear, I can confidently say that these boxer briefs exceed expectations on all fronts.First and foremost, the material is incredibly soft and breathable, thanks to the high-quality cotton construction. Whether I'm going about my daily activities or engaged in more rigorous exercise, these boxer briefs provide the comfort and support I need without feeling restrictive or uncomfortable.The ComfortFlex waistband is another standout feature of these boxer briefs. It provides a snug yet flexible fit that stays in place throughout the day, eliminating the need for constant adjustments. This waistband design ensures a secure and comfortable fit, no matter the activity or movement.One of the aspects I appreciate most about these boxer briefs is their durability. Despite regular wear and wash cycles, they hold up exceptionally well, maintaining their shape and elasticity over time. This durability speaks to the quality craftsmanship that Hanes is known for, making these boxer briefs a reliable investment in long-term comfort.The multipack offering is a convenient option, providing multiple pairs of boxer briefs in one purchase. This ensures that I always have a fresh pair available when needed, without having to constantly restock my underwear drawer.In terms of value, Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs offer excellent bang for your buck. The combination of comfort, durability, and affordability makes them a standout choice for anyone in search of reliable everyday underwear.Overall, I highly recommend Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs to anyone in need of comfortable and dependable underwear. From the soft cotton material to the ComfortFlex waistband and long-lasting durability, these boxer briefs check all the boxes for comfort and quality. Say goodbye to discomfort and hello to all-day comfort with Hanes.",
        "I have been a faithful user of briefs, but now I have switched to boxer briefs due to my inquisitive purchase of these Hanes boxers. I like their comfortable fit and the breathable materials. The waistbands are wide and very flexible, affording a pleasant fit and no rolling of the band itself into the waist and pinching. So, far (after several washes), they hold their color and have very little shrinkage. Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs are top-notch in design, comfort, and usefulness. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase was the cost. I think that it is a little high for underwear, but after doing some research, I found out that the cost of underwear is going up across the board with many manufacturers. With that said, Hanes Boxer Briefs are well worth their cost.",
        "I'm happy with the Hanes boxer briefs 12 pack. Decent price, good fit.  My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the sizing. I have a 35 inch waist, so I was undecided whether to get size Medium or Large. Large is advertised as fitting a 36 to 38 inch waist.  Small is 32-34. If size Large is appropriate for someone with a 38 inch waist, it sounded like they'd be too big, so I bought size Medium locally, and they were definitely too small. You can't return underwear after the package has been opened, so I ended up paying twice to get underwear that fits. I donated the size M to a clothing drive.  I'm pleased with the underwear.  However, if you have a size 38 waist, I don't think you'd be happy with size Large.",

        "Hubby is a large, they fit him perfectly and look comfortable and nice. The colors are nice too and they aren't fading in the wash at all.",
        "These fit well. Great value. Super comfortable. Can\u2019t miss.",
        "These babies keep my babies warm in the winter and cool in the summer. They also don't tear as easy like other brands do whenever my woman is in the \"mood\". They pull down rather easy and don't get well \"hung\" up when I'm standing at attention and she's trying to rip them off in a hurry in the bathroom of the local Chili's. They're soft on the chile too. Normally, I go commando but on special occasions like a date night out to Chili's, I'll wear them just for the adventure of feeling like I'm actually playing hard to get. I recommend them.",

They allow the equipment freedom to move, but the tighter leg fit prevents dribbles and don't ride up or wrap around as loose boxers do.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The material if soft and thick enough to absorb the occasional drip. They are comfortable, and don't ride up at all. The price is also pretty good.I would definitely recommend these boxer briefs.",

        "Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs have been a game-changer in my daily comfort and wearability. As someone who prioritizes both quality and comfort in underwear, I can confidently say that these boxer briefs exceed expectations on all fronts.First and foremost, the material is incredibly soft and breathable, thanks to the high-quality cotton construction. Whether I'm going about my daily activities or engaged in more rigorous exercise, these boxer briefs provide the comfort and support I need without feeling restrictive or uncomfortable.The ComfortFlex waistband is another standout feature of these boxer briefs. It provides a snug yet flexible fit that stays in place throughout the day, eliminating the need for constant adjustments. This waistband design ensures a secure and comfortable fit, no matter the activity or movement.One of the aspects I appreciate most about these boxer briefs is their durability. Despite regular wear and wash cycles, they hold up exceptionally well, maintaining their shape and elasticity over time. This durability speaks to the quality craftsmanship that Hanes is known for, making these boxer briefs a reliable investment in long-term comfort.The multipack offering is a convenient option, providing multiple pairs of boxer briefs in one purchase. This ensures that I always have a fresh pair available when needed, without having to constantly restock my underwear drawer.In terms of value, Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs offer excellent bang for your buck. The combination of comfort, durability, and affordability makes them a standout choice for anyone in search of reliable everyday underwear.Overall, I highly recommend Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs to anyone in need of comfortable and dependable underwear. From the soft cotton material to the ComfortFlex waistband and long-lasting durability, these boxer briefs check all the boxes for comfort and quality. Say goodbye to discomfort and hello to all-day comfort with Hanes.",
        "I have been a faithful user of briefs, but now I have switched to boxer briefs due to my inquisitive purchase of these Hanes boxers. I like their comfortable fit and the breathable materials. The waistbands are wide and very flexible, affording a pleasant fit and no rolling of the band itself into the waist and pinching. So, far (after several washes), they hold their color and have very little shrinkage. Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs are top-notch in design, comfort, and usefulness. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase was the cost. I think that it is a little high for underwear, but after doing some research, I found out that the cost of underwear is going up across the board with many manufacturers. With that said, Hanes Boxer Briefs are well worth their cost.",
        "I'm happy with the Hanes boxer briefs 12 pack. Decent price, good fit.  My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the sizing. I have a 35 inch waist, so I was undecided whether to get size Medium or Large. Large is advertised as fitting a 36 to 38 inch waist.  Small is 32-34. If size Large is appropriate for someone with a 38 inch waist, it sounded like they'd be too big, so I bought size Medium locally, and they were definitely too small. You can't return underwear after the package has been opened, so I ended up paying twice to get underwear that fits. I donated the size M to a clothing drive.  I'm pleased with the underwear.  However, if you have a size 38 waist, I don't think you'd be happy with size Large.",
        "These fits great and very comfortableRight size right priceVery pleased",
        "Hubby is a large, they fit him perfectly and look comfortable and nice. The colors are nice too and they aren't fading in the wash at all.",

        "These babies keep my babies warm in the winter and cool in the summer. They also don't tear as easy like other brands do whenever my woman is in the \"mood\". They pull down rather easy and don't get well \"hung\" up when I'm standing at attention and she's trying to rip them off in a hurry in the bathroom of the local Chili's. They're soft on the chile too. Normally, I go commando but on special occasions like a date night out to Chili's, I'll wear them just for the adventure of feeling like I'm actually playing hard to get. I recommend them.",
        "I would say it is comfortable which is really good about it. But I guess it is not made for short people - it is long. Which is fine by me. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable underwear. go for this one!",
        "Al verlos pens\u00e9 que eran m\u00e1s chicos que ma talla que ped\u00ed, de inicio quedan un poco apretados pero el material empieza a aflojarse con el uso como toda prenda. Son c\u00f3modos y la calidad es buena.",

        "Great value and nice product.",
        "I finally made the switch from briefs to boxers. These are the second pack of boxer briefs that I've tried.I find briefs are good at holding the equipment comfortably, but restrict the air and blood flow.Boxers allow the equipment to hang free, but also allow the occasional dribble down the leg, and ride up.These boxer briefs are a great compromise incorporating the best of both worlds, whilst eliminating the worst of both worlds.They are comfortable to wear. They allow the equipment freedom to move, but the tighter leg fit prevents dribbles and don't ride up or wrap around as loose boxers do.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The material if soft and thick enough to absorb the occasional drip. They are comfortable, and don't ride up at all. The price is also pretty good.I would definitely recommend these boxer briefs.",
        "Good quality / flexible boxer briefs, only negative for me is that they are a tad longer than I normally like, but this is a good deal. They are snug fit and do not bunch up. I like the design and color of this pack. Would recommend / buy again."

        "The Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Crew T-Shirt is a comfortable and reliable choice for everyday wear. The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and is breathable, making it suitable for various activities.One of the standout features of this T-shirt is its design, which includes a crew neck and a stay-in-place fit. I've found that the neckline retains its shape wash after wash, and the overall fit is true to size.The T-shirt is versatile and can be worn on its own or layered under other clothing. The classic design makes it easy to pair with different outfits, whether for casual or more dressed-up occasions.I appreciate the durability of this T-shirt, as it has held up well through multiple washes without losing its shape or color. The fabric also maintains its softness, even after repeated laundering.",
        "This review is for a 6-pack of Fruit of the Loom, White Medium T-Shirts. I've been buying/wearing this brand of T-Shirts for as long as I can remember. These are high quality (very soft 100% cotton), exceptionally comfortable T-Shirts, which fit me well and have a generous length (so no pulling out from my pants). Fabric is smooth to the touch, and not at all itchy. The fabric and stitching appear heavy duty and it looks like these T-Shirts should last several years. After several cycles of wearing, washing & drying, I've not noticed any shrinkage, creasing, discoloration, unraveling or tearing. At Amazon's price, these were a best value and a very good deal. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!",
        "Why I spent most of my life buying white undershirts is beyond me. These are great undershirts and resist staining better than your typical white one. I like the fact they are longer, so they stay tucked in. I typically buy one size smaller than I would a typical t-shirt, so they are snug and don't bunch up with the overshirt. The price is also right compared to the many other options on Amazon. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable undershirt, these are the ones. :)",
        "I liked the product. Good fit , nice",
        "Good price on 6 pack of t shirts. I use black for work. Washed up nice, and feels nice on the skin. A little big, but not  to big for size.",
        "I purchased these in men's small for my 13 year old twin boys.  They shrink a bit after washing, and are a perfect fit.  They use them primarily for pajama shirts, but sometimes also as undershirts.  They are soft and tag-free, so they like these shirts.  I would just say they run a little small, as in most shirts, they are Youth L or sometimes XL.",
        "They\u2019re soft and material does not feel \u201ccheap\u201d. They actually feel a little thicker - not super thin like other brands. They are generously sized - not short like some can run. I would definitely purchase again and recommend.",
        "Very comfortable. Fits to size. Long enough to tuck in. Good buy!!!",
        "Extra length is good enough to fit around my large stomach and still stayed tucked into my pants. Good quality. Comfortable. Material is thick enough to be warm, but not too thick. Got them for a good price. Expect many years of use as a good undershirt.",
        "El material es muy suave y te permite transpirar. La medida excelente en M\u00e9xico.",
        "Excelentes playeras, bien c\u00f3modas y buen material 100% recomendadas",

        "I love Fruit of the Loom 100% cotton white T-shirts. I have probably bought more than a hundred of them for the last 15 years, mainly as work undershirts. Also, at home, there\u2019s nothing like wearing a 100% cotton, soft and comfy shirt for all seasons. I usually buy these from Walmart, so it's my first time buying Fruit of the Loom T-shirts  from Amazon. It\u2019s also my first time buying in multi-color.Yes, I have read the reviews advising me to buy one size up, especially because of shrinkage after laundry. I was so stubborn I did not listen. I ordered my usual medium size, only to realize I indeed should have listened to the previous reviewers. I ended up returning the medium size and buying one size up for me \u2013 the large size.Anyway, I am so happy that out of the 6 large T-shirts delivered, five of them are 100% cotton. The heather gray is 90% cotton and 10% polyester, but it still feels like almost 100% cotton, so I can\u2019t complain. These are so comfortable and perfect for all seasons (paired with a sweater, of course, during winter).Prompt delivery, no damage or defects, soft and comfortable, value for money, and environmentally friendly packaging \u2013 I would definitely buy again. It is five stars for sure."

        "The Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Crew T-Shirt is a comfortable and reliable choice for everyday wear. The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and is breathable, making it suitable for various activities.One of the standout features of this T-shirt is its design, which includes a crew neck and a stay-in-place fit. I've found that the neckline retains its shape wash after wash, and the overall fit is true to size.The T-shirt is versatile and can be worn on its own or layered under other clothing. The classic design makes it easy to pair with different outfits, whether for casual or more dressed-up occasions.I appreciate the durability of this T-shirt, as it has held up well through multiple washes without losing its shape or color. The fabric also maintains its softness, even after repeated laundering.",
        "This review is for a 6-pack of Fruit of the Loom, White Medium T-Shirts. I've been buying/wearing this brand of T-Shirts for as long as I can remember. These are high quality (very soft 100% cotton), exceptionally comfortable T-Shirts, which fit me well and have a generous length (so no pulling out from my pants). Fabric is smooth to the touch, and not at all itchy. The fabric and stitching appear heavy duty and it looks like these T-Shirts should last several years. After several cycles of wearing, washing & drying, I've not noticed any shrinkage, creasing, discoloration, unraveling or tearing. At Amazon's price, these were a best value and a very good deal. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!",
        "Why I spent most of my life buying white undershirts is beyond me. These are great undershirts and resist staining better than your typical white one. I like the fact they are longer, so they stay tucked in. I typically buy one size smaller than I would a typical t-shirt, so they are snug and don't bunch up with the overshirt. The price is also right compared to the many other options on Amazon. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable undershirt, these are the ones. :)",

        "Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs have been a game-changer in my daily comfort and wearability. As someone who prioritizes both quality and comfort in underwear, I can confidently say that these boxer briefs exceed expectations on all fronts.First and foremost, the material is incredibly soft and breathable, thanks to the high-quality cotton construction. Whether I'm going about my daily activities or engaged in more rigorous exercise, these boxer briefs provide the comfort and support I need without feeling restrictive or uncomfortable.The ComfortFlex waistband is another standout feature of these boxer briefs. It provides a snug yet flexible fit that stays in place throughout the day, eliminating the need for constant adjustments. This waistband design ensures a secure and comfortable fit, no matter the activity or movement.One of the aspects I appreciate most about these boxer briefs is their durability. Despite regular wear and wash cycles, they hold up exceptionally well, maintaining their shape and elasticity over time. This durability speaks to the quality craftsmanship that Hanes is known for, making these boxer briefs a reliable investment in long-term comfort.The multipack offering is a convenient option, providing multiple pairs of boxer briefs in one purchase. This ensures that I always have a fresh pair available when needed, without having to constantly restock my underwear drawer.In terms of value, Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs offer excellent bang for your buck. The combination of comfort, durability, and affordability makes them a standout choice for anyone in search of reliable everyday underwear.Overall, I highly recommend Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs to anyone in need of comfortable and dependable underwear. From the soft cotton material to the ComfortFlex waistband and long-lasting durability, these boxer briefs check all the boxes for comfort and quality. Say goodbye to discomfort and hello to all-day comfort with Hanes.",
        "I have been a faithful user of briefs, but now I have switched to boxer briefs due to my inquisitive purchase of these Hanes boxers. I like their comfortable fit and the breathable materials. The waistbands are wide and very flexible, affording a pleasant fit and no rolling of the band itself into the waist and pinching. So, far (after several washes), they hold their color and have very little shrinkage. Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs are top-notch in design, comfort, and usefulness. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase was the cost. I think that it is a little high for underwear, but after doing some research, I found out that the cost of underwear is going up across the board with many manufacturers. With that said, Hanes Boxer Briefs are well worth their cost.",
        "I'm happy with the Hanes boxer briefs 12 pack. Decent price, good fit.  My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the sizing. I have a 35 inch waist, so I was undecided whether to get size Medium or Large. Large is advertised as fitting a 36 to 38 inch waist.  Small is 32-34. If size Large is appropriate for someone with a 38 inch waist, it sounded like they'd be too big, so I bought size Medium locally, and they were definitely too small. You can't return underwear after the package has been opened, so I ended up paying twice to get underwear that fits. I donated the size M to a clothing drive.  I'm pleased with the underwear.  However, if you have a size 38 waist, I don't think you'd be happy with size Large.",
        "These fits great and very comfortableRight size right priceVery pleased",
        "Hubby is a large, they fit him perfectly and look comfortable and nice. The colors are nice too and they aren't fading in the wash at all.",
        "These fit well. Great value. Super comfortable. Can\u2019t miss.",
        "These babies keep my babies warm in the winter and cool in the summer. They also don't tear as easy like other brands do whenever my woman is in the \"mood\". They pull down rather easy and don't get well \"hung\" up when I'm standing at attention and she's trying to rip them off in a hurry in the bathroom of the local Chili's. They're soft on the chile too. Normally, I go commando but on special occasions like a date night out to Chili's, I'll wear them just for the adventure of feeling like I'm actually playing hard to get. I recommend them.",
        "I would say it is comfortable which is really good about it. But I guess it is not made for short people - it is long. Which is fine by me. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable underwear. go for this one!",
        "Al verlos pens\u00e9 que eran m\u00e1s chicos que ma talla que ped\u00ed, de inicio quedan un poco apretados pero el material empieza a aflojarse con el uso como toda prenda. Son c\u00f3modos y la calidad es buena.",

They allow the equipment freedom to move, but the tighter leg fit prevents dribbles and don't ride up or wrap around as loose boxers do.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The material if soft and thick enough to absorb the occasional drip. They are comfortable, and don't ride up at all. The price is also pretty good.I would definitely recommend these boxer briefs.",
        "Good quality / flexible boxer briefs, only negative for me is that they are a tad longer than I normally like, but this is a good deal. They are snug fit and do not bunch up. I like the design and color of this pack. Would recommend / buy again."

As someone who prioritizes both quality and comfort in underwear, I can confidently say that these boxer briefs exceed expectations on all fronts.First and foremost, the material is incredibly soft and breathable, thanks to the high-quality cotton construction. Whether I'm going about my daily activities or engaged in more rigorous exercise, these boxer briefs provide the comfort and support I need without feeling restrictive or uncomfortable.The ComfortFlex waistband is another standout feature of these boxer briefs. It provides a snug yet flexible fit that stays in place throughout the day, eliminating the need for constant adjustments. This waistband design ensures a secure and comfortable fit, no matter the activity or movement.One of the aspects I appreciate most about these boxer briefs is their durability. Despite regular wear and wash cycles, they hold up exceptionally well, maintaining their shape and elasticity over time. This durability speaks to the quality craftsmanship that Hanes is known for, making these boxer briefs a reliable investment in long-term comfort.The multipack offering is a convenient option, providing multiple pairs of boxer briefs in one purchase. This ensures that I always have a fresh pair available when needed, without having to constantly restock my underwear drawer.In terms of value, Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs offer excellent bang for your buck. The combination of comfort, durability, and affordability makes them a standout choice for anyone in search of reliable everyday underwear.Overall, I highly recommend Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs to anyone in need of comfortable and dependable underwear. From the soft cotton material to the ComfortFlex waistband and long-lasting durability, these boxer briefs check all the boxes for comfort and quality. Say goodbye to discomfort and hello to all-day comfort with Hanes.",
        "I have been a faithful user of briefs, but now I have switched to boxer briefs due to my inquisitive purchase of these Hanes boxers. I like their comfortable fit and the breathable materials. The waistbands are wide and very flexible, affording a pleasant fit and no rolling of the band itself into the waist and pinching. So, far (after several washes), they hold their color and have very little shrinkage. Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs are top-notch in design, comfort, and usefulness. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase was the cost. I think that it is a little high for underwear, but after doing some research, I found out that the cost of underwear is going up across the board with many manufacturers. With that said, Hanes Boxer Briefs are well worth their cost.",
        "I'm happy with the Hanes boxer briefs 12 pack. Decent price, good fit.  My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the sizing. I have a 35 inch waist, so I was undecided whether to get size Medium or Large. Large is advertised as fitting a 36 to 38 inch waist.  Small is 32-34. If size Large is appropriate for someone with a 38 inch waist, it sounded like they'd be too big, so I bought size Medium locally, and they were definitely too small. You can't return underwear after the package has been opened, so I ended up paying twice to get underwear that fits. I donated the size M to a clothing drive.  I'm pleased with the underwear.  However, if you have a size 38 waist, I don't think you'd be happy with size Large.",
        "These fits great and very comfortableRight size right priceVery pleased",
        "Hubby is a large, they fit him perfectly and look comfortable and nice. The colors are nice too and they aren't fading in the wash at all.",
        "These fit well. Great value. Super comfortable. Can\u2019t miss.",
        "These babies keep my babies warm in the winter and cool in the summer. They also don't tear as easy like other brands do whenever my woman is in the \"mood\". They pull down rather easy and don't get well \"hung\" up when I'm standing at attention and she's trying to rip them off in a hurry in the bathroom of the local Chili's. They're soft on the chile too. Normally, I go commando but on special occasions like a date night out to Chili's, I'll wear them just for the adventure of feeling like I'm actually playing hard to get. I recommend them.",
        "I would say it is comfortable which is really good about it. But I guess it is not made for short people - it is long. Which is fine by me. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable underwear. go for this one!",
        "Al verlos pens\u00e9 que eran m\u00e1s chicos que ma talla que ped\u00ed, de inicio quedan un poco apretados pero el material empieza a aflojarse con el uso como toda prenda. Son c\u00f3modos y la calidad es buena.",

        "Great value and nice product.",
        "I finally made the switch from briefs to boxers. These are the second pack of boxer briefs that I've tried.I find briefs are good at holding the equipment comfortably, but restrict the air and blood flow.Boxers allow the equipment to hang free, but also allow the occasional dribble down the leg, and ride up.These boxer briefs are a great compromise incorporating the best of both worlds, whilst eliminating the worst of both worlds.They are comfortable to wear. They allow the equipment freedom to move, but the tighter leg fit prevents dribbles and don't ride up or wrap around as loose boxers do.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The material if soft and thick enough to absorb the occasional drip. They are comfortable, and don't ride up at all. The price is also pretty good.I would definitely recommend these boxer briefs.",
        "Good quality / flexible boxer briefs, only negative for me is that they are a tad longer than I normally like, but this is a good deal. They are snug fit and do not bunch up. I like the design and color of this pack. Would recommend / buy again."

        "The Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Crew T-Shirt is a comfortable and reliable choice for everyday wear. The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and is breathable, making it suitable for various activities.One of the standout features of this T-shirt is its design, which includes a crew neck and a stay-in-place fit. I've found that the neckline retains its shape wash after wash, and the overall fit is true to size.The T-shirt is versatile and can be worn on its own or layered under other clothing. The classic design makes it easy to pair with different outfits, whether for casual or more dressed-up occasions.I appreciate the durability of this T-shirt, as it has held up well through multiple washes without losing its shape or color. The fabric also maintains its softness, even after repeated laundering.",
        "This review is for a 6-pack of Fruit of the Loom, White Medium T-Shirts. I've been buying/wearing this brand of T-Shirts for as long as I can remember. These are high quality (very soft 100% cotton), exceptionally comfortable T-Shirts, which fit me well and have a generous length (so no pulling out from my pants). Fabric is smooth to the touch, and not at all itchy. The fabric and stitching appear heavy duty and it looks like these T-Shirts should last several years. After several cycles of wearing, washing & drying, I've not noticed any shrinkage, creasing, discoloration, unraveling or tearing. At Amazon's price, these were a best value and a very good deal. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!",
        "Why I spent most of my life buying white undershirts is beyond me. These are great undershirts and resist staining better than your typical white one. I like the fact they are longer, so they stay tucked in. I typically buy one size smaller than I would a typical t-shirt, so they are snug and don't bunch up with the overshirt. The price is also right compared to the many other options on Amazon. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable undershirt, these are the ones. :)",
        "I liked the product. Good fit , nice",
        "Good price on 6 pack of t shirts. I use black for work. Washed up nice, and feels nice on the skin. A little big, but not  to big for size.",
        "I purchased these in men's small for my 13 year old twin boys.  They shrink a bit after washing, and are a perfect fit.  They use them primarily for pajama shirts, but sometimes also as undershirts.  They are soft and tag-free, so they like these shirts.  I would just say they run a little small, as in most shirts, they are Youth L or sometimes XL.",
        "They\u2019re soft and material does not feel \u201ccheap\u201d. They actually feel a little thicker - not super thin like other brands. They are generously sized - not short like some can run. I would definitely purchase again and recommend.",
        "Very comfortable. Fits to size. Long enough to tuck in. Good buy!!!",
        "Extra length is good enough to fit around my large stomach and still stayed tucked into my pants. Good quality. Comfortable. Material is thick enough to be warm, but not too thick. Got them for a good price. Expect many years of use as a good undershirt.",
        "El material es muy suave y te permite transpirar. La medida excelente en M\u00e9xico.",
        "Excelentes playeras, bien c\u00f3modas y buen material 100% recomendadas",

        "I love Fruit of the Loom 100% cotton white T-shirts. I have probably bought more than a hundred of them for the last 15 years, mainly as work undershirts. Also, at home, there\u2019s nothing like wearing a 100% cotton, soft and comfy shirt for all seasons. I usually buy these from Walmart, so it's my first time buying Fruit of the Loom T-shirts  from Amazon. It\u2019s also my first time buying in multi-color.Yes, I have read the reviews advising me to buy one size up, especially because of shrinkage after laundry. I was so stubborn I did not listen. I ordered my usual medium size, only to realize I indeed should have listened to the previous reviewers. I ended up returning the medium size and buying one size up for me \u2013 the large size.Anyway, I am so happy that out of the 6 large T-shirts delivered, five of them are 100% cotton. The heather gray is 90% cotton and 10% polyester, but it still feels like almost 100% cotton, so I can\u2019t complain. These are so comfortable and perfect for all seasons (paired with a sweater, of course, during winter).Prompt delivery, no damage or defects, soft and comfortable, value for money, and environmentally friendly packaging \u2013 I would definitely buy again. It is five stars for sure."

        "The Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Crew T-Shirt is a comfortable and reliable choice for everyday wear. The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and is breathable, making it suitable for various activities.One of the standout features of this T-shirt is its design, which includes a crew neck and a stay-in-place fit. I've found that the neckline retains its shape wash after wash, and the overall fit is true to size.The T-shirt is versatile and can be worn on its own or layered under other clothing. The classic design makes it easy to pair with different outfits, whether for casual or more dressed-up occasions.I appreciate the durability of this T-shirt, as it has held up well through multiple washes without losing its shape or color. The fabric also maintains its softness, even after repeated laundering.",
        "This review is for a 6-pack of Fruit of the Loom, White Medium T-Shirts. I've been buying/wearing this brand of T-Shirts for as long as I can remember. These are high quality (very soft 100% cotton), exceptionally comfortable T-Shirts, which fit me well and have a generous length (so no pulling out from my pants). Fabric is smooth to the touch, and not at all itchy. The fabric and stitching appear heavy duty and it looks like these T-Shirts should last several years. After several cycles of wearing, washing & drying, I've not noticed any shrinkage, creasing, discoloration, unraveling or tearing. At Amazon's price, these were a best value and a very good deal. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!",
        "Why I spent most of my life buying white undershirts is beyond me. These are great undershirts and resist staining better than your typical white one. I like the fact they are longer, so they stay tucked in. I typically buy one size smaller than I would a typical t-shirt, so they are snug and don't bunch up with the overshirt. The price is also right compared to the many other options on Amazon. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable undershirt, these are the ones. :)",

        "Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs have been a game-changer in my daily comfort and wearability. As someone who prioritizes both quality and comfort in underwear, I can confidently say that these boxer briefs exceed expectations on all fronts.First and foremost, the material is incredibly soft and breathable, thanks to the high-quality cotton construction. Whether I'm going about my daily activities or engaged in more rigorous exercise, these boxer briefs provide the comfort and support I need without feeling restrictive or uncomfortable.The ComfortFlex waistband is another standout feature of these boxer briefs. It provides a snug yet flexible fit that stays in place throughout the day, eliminating the need for constant adjustments. This waistband design ensures a secure and comfortable fit, no matter the activity or movement.One of the aspects I appreciate most about these boxer briefs is their durability. Despite regular wear and wash cycles, they hold up exceptionally well, maintaining their shape and elasticity over time. This durability speaks to the quality craftsmanship that Hanes is known for, making these boxer briefs a reliable investment in long-term comfort.The multipack offering is a convenient option, providing multiple pairs of boxer briefs in one purchase. This ensures that I always have a fresh pair available when needed, without having to constantly restock my underwear drawer.In terms of value, Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs offer excellent bang for your buck. The combination of comfort, durability, and affordability makes them a standout choice for anyone in search of reliable everyday underwear.Overall, I highly recommend Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs to anyone in need of comfortable and dependable underwear. From the soft cotton material to the ComfortFlex waistband and long-lasting durability, these boxer briefs check all the boxes for comfort and quality. Say goodbye to discomfort and hello to all-day comfort with Hanes.",
        "I have been a faithful user of briefs, but now I have switched to boxer briefs due to my inquisitive purchase of these Hanes boxers. I like their comfortable fit and the breathable materials. The waistbands are wide and very flexible, affording a pleasant fit and no rolling of the band itself into the waist and pinching. So, far (after several washes), they hold their color and have very little shrinkage. Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs are top-notch in design, comfort, and usefulness. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase was the cost. I think that it is a little high for underwear, but after doing some research, I found out that the cost of underwear is going up across the board with many manufacturers. With that said, Hanes Boxer Briefs are well worth their cost.",
        "I'm happy with the Hanes boxer briefs 12 pack. Decent price, good fit.  My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the sizing. I have a 35 inch waist, so I was undecided whether to get size Medium or Large. Large is advertised as fitting a 36 to 38 inch waist.  Small is 32-34. If size Large is appropriate for someone with a 38 inch waist, it sounded like they'd be too big, so I bought size Medium locally, and they were definitely too small. You can't return underwear after the package has been opened, so I ended up paying twice to get underwear that fits. I donated the size M to a clothing drive.  I'm pleased with the underwear.  However, if you have a size 38 waist, I don't think you'd be happy with size Large.",
        "These fits great and very comfortableRight size right priceVery pleased",
        "Hubby is a large, they fit him perfectly and look comfortable and nice. The colors are nice too and they aren't fading in the wash at all.",
        "These fit well. Great value. Super comfortable. Can\u2019t miss.",
        "These babies keep my babies warm in the winter and cool in the summer. They also don't tear as easy like other brands do whenever my woman is in the \"mood\". They pull down rather easy and don't get well \"hung\" up when I'm standing at attention and she's trying to rip them off in a hurry in the bathroom of the local Chili's. They're soft on the chile too. Normally, I go commando but on special occasions like a date night out to Chili's, I'll wear them just for the adventure of feeling like I'm actually playing hard to get. I recommend them.",
        "I would say it is comfortable which is really good about it. But I guess it is not made for short people - it is long. Which is fine by me. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable underwear. go for this one!",
        "Al verlos pens\u00e9 que eran m\u00e1s chicos que ma talla que ped\u00ed, de inicio quedan un poco apretados pero el material empieza a aflojarse con el uso como toda prenda. Son c\u00f3modos y la calidad es buena.",
        "Love the colors, great valueHubby says they're comfy.RecommendedTrue to size",
        "Great value and nice product.",
        "I finally made the switch from briefs to boxers. These are the second pack of boxer briefs that I've tried.I find briefs are good at holding the equipment comfortably, but restrict the air and blood flow.Boxers allow the equipment to hang free, but also allow the occasional dribble down the leg, and ride up.These boxer briefs are a great compromise incorporating the best of both worlds, whilst eliminating the worst of both worlds.They are comfortable to wear. They allow the equipment freedom to move, but the tighter leg fit prevents dribbles and don't ride up or wrap around as loose boxers do.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The material if soft and thick enough to absorb the occasional drip. They are comfortable, and don't ride up at all. The price is also pretty good.I would definitely recommend these boxer briefs.",
        "Good quality / flexible boxer briefs, only negative for me is that they are a tad longer than I normally like, but this is a good deal. They are snug fit and do not bunch up. I like the design and color of this pack. Would recommend / buy again."

The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and is breathable, making it suitable for various activities.One of the standout features of this T-shirt is its design, which includes a crew neck and a stay-in-place fit.

        "This review is for a 6-pack of Fruit of the Loom, White Medium T-Shirts. I've been buying/wearing this brand of T-Shirts for as long as I can remember. These are high quality (very soft 100% cotton), exceptionally comfortable T-Shirts, which fit me well and have a generous length (so no pulling out from my pants). Fabric is smooth to the touch, and not at all itchy. The fabric and stitching appear heavy duty and it looks like these T-Shirts should last several years. After several cycles of wearing, washing & drying, I've not noticed any shrinkage, creasing, discoloration, unraveling or tearing. At Amazon's price, these were a best value and a very good deal. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!",
        "Why I spent most of my life buying white undershirts is beyond me. These are great undershirts and resist staining better than your typical white one. I like the fact they are longer, so they stay tucked in. I typically buy one size smaller than I would a typical t-shirt, so they are snug and don't bunch up with the overshirt. The price is also right compared to the many other options on Amazon. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable undershirt, these are the ones. :)",
        "I liked the product. Good fit , nice",
        "Good price on 6 pack of t shirts. I use black for work. Washed up nice, and feels nice on the skin. A little big, but not  to big for size.",
        "I purchased these in men's small for my 13 year old twin boys.  They shrink a bit after washing, and are a perfect fit.  They use them primarily for pajama shirts, but sometimes also as undershirts.  They are soft and tag-free, so they like these shirts.  I would just say they run a little small, as in most shirts, they are Youth L or sometimes XL.",
        "They\u2019re soft and material does not feel \u201ccheap\u201d. They actually feel a little thicker - not super thin like other brands. They are generously sized - not short like some can run. I would definitely purchase again and recommend.",
        "Very comfortable. Fits to size. Long enough to tuck in. Good buy!!!",
        "Extra length is good enough to fit around my large stomach and still stayed tucked into my pants. Good quality. Comfortable. Material is thick enough to be warm, but not too thick. Got them for a good price. Expect many years of use as a good undershirt.",
        "El material es muy suave y te permite transpirar. La medida excelente en M\u00e9xico.",

Also, at home, there\u2019s nothing like wearing a 100% cotton, soft and comfy shirt for all seasons. I usually buy these from Walmart, so it's my first time buying Fruit of the Loom T-shirts  from Amazon. It\u2019s also my first time buying in multi-color.Yes, I have read the reviews advising me to buy one size up, especially because of shrinkage after laundry. I was so stubborn I did not listen. I ordered my usual medium size, only to realize I indeed should have listened to the previous reviewers. I ended up returning the medium size and buying one size up for me \u2013 the large size.Anyway, I am so happy that out of the 6 large T-shirts delivered, five of them are 100% cotton. The heather gray is 90% cotton and 10% polyester, but it still feels like almost 100% cotton, so I can\u2019t complain. These are so comfortable and perfect for all seasons (paired with a sweater, of course, during winter).Prompt delivery, no damage or defects, soft and comfortable, value for money, and environmentally friendly packaging \u2013 I would definitely buy again. It is five stars for sure."

        "Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs have been a game-changer in my daily comfort and wearability. As someone who prioritizes both quality and comfort in underwear, I can confidently say that these boxer briefs exceed expectations on all fronts.First and foremost, the material is incredibly soft and breathable, thanks to the high-quality cotton construction. Whether I'm going about my daily activities or engaged in more rigorous exercise, these boxer briefs provide the comfort and support I need without feeling restrictive or uncomfortable.The ComfortFlex waistband is another standout feature of these boxer briefs. It provides a snug yet flexible fit that stays in place throughout the day, eliminating the need for constant adjustments. This waistband design ensures a secure and comfortable fit, no matter the activity or movement.One of the aspects I appreciate most about these boxer briefs is their durability. Despite regular wear and wash cycles, they hold up exceptionally well, maintaining their shape and elasticity over time. This durability speaks to the quality craftsmanship that Hanes is known for, making these boxer briefs a reliable investment in long-term comfort.The multipack offering is a convenient option, providing multiple pairs of boxer briefs in one purchase. This ensures that I always have a fresh pair available when needed, without having to constantly restock my underwear drawer.In terms of value, Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs offer excellent bang for your buck. The combination of comfort, durability, and affordability makes them a standout choice for anyone in search of reliable everyday underwear.Overall, I highly recommend Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs to anyone in need of comfortable and dependable underwear. From the soft cotton material to the ComfortFlex waistband and long-lasting durability, these boxer briefs check all the boxes for comfort and quality. Say goodbye to discomfort and hello to all-day comfort with Hanes.",
        "I have been a faithful user of briefs, but now I have switched to boxer briefs due to my inquisitive purchase of these Hanes boxers. I like their comfortable fit and the breathable materials. The waistbands are wide and very flexible, affording a pleasant fit and no rolling of the band itself into the waist and pinching. So, far (after several washes), they hold their color and have very little shrinkage. Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs are top-notch in design, comfort, and usefulness. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase was the cost. I think that it is a little high for underwear, but after doing some research, I found out that the cost of underwear is going up across the board with many manufacturers. With that said, Hanes Boxer Briefs are well worth their cost.",
        "I'm happy with the Hanes boxer briefs 12 pack. Decent price, good fit.  My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the sizing. I have a 35 inch waist, so I was undecided whether to get size Medium or Large. Large is advertised as fitting a 36 to 38 inch waist.  Small is 32-34. If size Large is appropriate for someone with a 38 inch waist, it sounded like they'd be too big, so I bought size Medium locally, and they were definitely too small. You can't return underwear after the package has been opened, so I ended up paying twice to get underwear that fits. I donated the size M to a clothing drive.  I'm pleased with the underwear.  However, if you have a size 38 waist, I don't think you'd be happy with size Large.",
        "These fits great and very comfortableRight size right priceVery pleased",
        "Hubby is a large, they fit him perfectly and look comfortable and nice. The colors are nice too and they aren't fading in the wash at all.",
        "These fit well. Great value. Super comfortable. Can\u2019t miss.",
        "These babies keep my babies warm in the winter and cool in the summer. They also don't tear as easy like other brands do whenever my woman is in the \"mood\". They pull down rather easy and don't get well \"hung\" up when I'm standing at attention and she's trying to rip them off in a hurry in the bathroom of the local Chili's. They're soft on the chile too. Normally, I go commando but on special occasions like a date night out to Chili's, I'll wear them just for the adventure of feeling like I'm actually playing hard to get. I recommend them.",
        "I would say it is comfortable which is really good about it. But I guess it is not made for short people - it is long. Which is fine by me. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable underwear. go for this one!",
        "Al verlos pens\u00e9 que eran m\u00e1s chicos que ma talla que ped\u00ed, de inicio quedan un poco apretados pero el material empieza a aflojarse con el uso como toda prenda. Son c\u00f3modos y la calidad es buena.",
        "Love the colors, great valueHubby says they're comfy.RecommendedTrue to size",
        "Great value and nice product.",
        "I finally made the switch from briefs to boxers. These are the second pack of boxer briefs that I've tried.I find briefs are good at holding the equipment comfortably, but restrict the air and blood flow.Boxers allow the equipment to hang free, but also allow the occasional dribble down the leg, and ride up.These boxer briefs are a great compromise incorporating the best of both worlds, whilst eliminating the worst of both worlds.They are comfortable to wear. They allow the equipment freedom to move, but the tighter leg fit prevents dribbles and don't ride up or wrap around as loose boxers do.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The material if soft and thick enough to absorb the occasional drip. They are comfortable, and don't ride up at all. The price is also pretty good.I would definitely recommend these boxer briefs.",
        "Good quality / flexible boxer briefs, only negative for me is that they are a tad longer than I normally like, but this is a good deal. They are snug fit and do not bunch up. I like the design and color of this pack. Would recommend / buy again."

        "Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs have been a game-changer in my daily comfort and wearability. As someone who prioritizes both quality and comfort in underwear, I can confidently say that these boxer briefs exceed expectations on all fronts.First and foremost, the material is incredibly soft and breathable, thanks to the high-quality cotton construction. Whether I'm going about my daily activities or engaged in more rigorous exercise, these boxer briefs provide the comfort and support I need without feeling restrictive or uncomfortable.The ComfortFlex waistband is another standout feature of these boxer briefs. It provides a snug yet flexible fit that stays in place throughout the day, eliminating the need for constant adjustments. This waistband design ensures a secure and comfortable fit, no matter the activity or movement.One of the aspects I appreciate most about these boxer briefs is their durability. Despite regular wear and wash cycles, they hold up exceptionally well, maintaining their shape and elasticity over time. This durability speaks to the quality craftsmanship that Hanes is known for, making these boxer briefs a reliable investment in long-term comfort.The multipack offering is a convenient option, providing multiple pairs of boxer briefs in one purchase. This ensures that I always have a fresh pair available when needed, without having to constantly restock my underwear drawer.In terms of value, Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs offer excellent bang for your buck. The combination of comfort, durability, and affordability makes them a standout choice for anyone in search of reliable everyday underwear.Overall, I highly recommend Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs to anyone in need of comfortable and dependable underwear. From the soft cotton material to the ComfortFlex waistband and long-lasting durability, these boxer briefs check all the boxes for comfort and quality. Say goodbye to discomfort and hello to all-day comfort with Hanes.",
        "I have been a faithful user of briefs, but now I have switched to boxer briefs due to my inquisitive purchase of these Hanes boxers. I like their comfortable fit and the breathable materials. The waistbands are wide and very flexible, affording a pleasant fit and no rolling of the band itself into the waist and pinching. So, far (after several washes), they hold their color and have very little shrinkage. Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs are top-notch in design, comfort, and usefulness. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase was the cost. I think that it is a little high for underwear, but after doing some research, I found out that the cost of underwear is going up across the board with many manufacturers. With that said, Hanes Boxer Briefs are well worth their cost.",
        "I'm happy with the Hanes boxer briefs 12 pack. Decent price, good fit.  My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the sizing. I have a 35 inch waist, so I was undecided whether to get size Medium or Large. Large is advertised as fitting a 36 to 38 inch waist.  Small is 32-34. If size Large is appropriate for someone with a 38 inch waist, it sounded like they'd be too big, so I bought size Medium locally, and they were definitely too small. You can't return underwear after the package has been opened, so I ended up paying twice to get underwear that fits. I donated the size M to a clothing drive.  I'm pleased with the underwear.  However, if you have a size 38 waist, I don't think you'd be happy with size Large.",
        "These fits great and very comfortableRight size right priceVery pleased",
        "Hubby is a large, they fit him perfectly and look comfortable and nice. The colors are nice too and they aren't fading in the wash at all.",
        "These fit well. Great value. Super comfortable. Can\u2019t miss.",
        "These babies keep my babies warm in the winter and cool in the summer. They also don't tear as easy like other brands do whenever my woman is in the \"mood\". They pull down rather easy and don't get well \"hung\" up when I'm standing at attention and she's trying to rip them off in a hurry in the bathroom of the local Chili's. They're soft on the chile too. Normally, I go commando but on special occasions like a date night out to Chili's, I'll wear them just for the adventure of feeling like I'm actually playing hard to get. I recommend them.",
        "I would say it is comfortable which is really good about it. But I guess it is not made for short people - it is long. Which is fine by me. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable underwear. go for this one!",
        "Al verlos pens\u00e9 que eran m\u00e1s chicos que ma talla que ped\u00ed, de inicio quedan un poco apretados pero el material empieza a aflojarse con el uso como toda prenda. Son c\u00f3modos y la calidad es buena.",
        "Love the colors, great valueHubby says they're comfy.RecommendedTrue to size",
        "Great value and nice product.",
        "I finally made the switch from briefs to boxers. These are the second pack of boxer briefs that I've tried.I find briefs are good at holding the equipment comfortably, but restrict the air and blood flow.Boxers allow the equipment to hang free, but also allow the occasional dribble down the leg, and ride up.These boxer briefs are a great compromise incorporating the best of both worlds, whilst eliminating the worst of both worlds.They are comfortable to wear. They allow the equipment freedom to move, but the tighter leg fit prevents dribbles and don't ride up or wrap around as loose boxers do.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The material if soft and thick enough to absorb the occasional drip. They are comfortable, and don't ride up at all. The price is also pretty good.I would definitely recommend these boxer briefs.",
        "Good quality / flexible boxer briefs, only negative for me is that they are a tad longer than I normally like, but this is a good deal. They are snug fit and do not bunch up. I like the design and color of this pack. Would recommend / buy again."

The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and is breathable, making it suitable for various activities.One of the standout features of this T-shirt is its design, which includes a crew neck and a stay-in-place fit.

The fabric also maintains its softness, even after repeated laundering.",
        "This review is for a 6-pack of Fruit of the Loom, White Medium T-Shirts. I've been buying/wearing this brand of T-Shirts for as long as I can remember. These are high quality (very soft 100% cotton), exceptionally comfortable T-Shirts, which fit me well and have a generous length (so no pulling out from my pants). Fabric is smooth to the touch, and not at all itchy. The fabric and stitching appear heavy duty and it looks like these T-Shirts should last several years. After several cycles of wearing, washing & drying, I've not noticed any shrinkage, creasing, discoloration, unraveling or tearing. At Amazon's price, these were a best value and a very good deal. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!",
        "Why I spent most of my life buying white undershirts is beyond me. These are great undershirts and resist staining better than your typical white one. I like the fact they are longer, so they stay tucked in. I typically buy one size smaller than I would a typical t-shirt, so they are snug and don't bunch up with the overshirt. The price is also right compared to the many other options on Amazon. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable undershirt, these are the ones. :)",
        "I liked the product. Good fit , nice",
        "Good price on 6 pack of t shirts. I use black for work. Washed up nice, and feels nice on the skin. A little big, but not  to big for size.",
        "I purchased these in men's small for my 13 year old twin boys.  They shrink a bit after washing, and are a perfect fit.  They use them primarily for pajama shirts, but sometimes also as undershirts.  They are soft and tag-free, so they like these shirts.  I would just say they run a little small, as in most shirts, they are Youth L or sometimes XL.",
        "They\u2019re soft and material does not feel \u201ccheap\u201d. They actually feel a little thicker - not super thin like other brands. They are generously sized - not short like some can run. I would definitely purchase again and recommend.",
        "Very comfortable. Fits to size. Long enough to tuck in. Good buy!!!",
        "Extra length is good enough to fit around my large stomach and still stayed tucked into my pants. Good quality. Comfortable. Material is thick enough to be warm, but not too thick. Got them for a good price. Expect many years of use as a good undershirt.",
        "El material es muy suave y te permite transpirar. La medida excelente en M\u00e9xico.",
        "Excelentes playeras, bien c\u00f3modas y buen material 100% recomendadas",

        "I love Fruit of the Loom 100% cotton white T-shirts. I have probably bought more than a hundred of them for the last 15 years, mainly as work undershirts. Also, at home, there\u2019s nothing like wearing a 100% cotton, soft and comfy shirt for all seasons. I usually buy these from Walmart, so it's my first time buying Fruit of the Loom T-shirts  from Amazon. It\u2019s also my first time buying in multi-color.Yes, I have read the reviews advising me to buy one size up, especially because of shrinkage after laundry. I was so stubborn I did not listen. I ordered my usual medium size, only to realize I indeed should have listened to the previous reviewers. I ended up returning the medium size and buying one size up for me \u2013 the large size.Anyway, I am so happy that out of the 6 large T-shirts delivered, five of them are 100% cotton. The heather gray is 90% cotton and 10% polyester, but it still feels like almost 100% cotton, so I can\u2019t complain. These are so comfortable and perfect for all seasons (paired with a sweater, of course, during winter).Prompt delivery, no damage or defects, soft and comfortable, value for money, and environmentally friendly packaging \u2013 I would definitely buy again. It is five stars for sure."

        "Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs have been a game-changer in my daily comfort and wearability. As someone who prioritizes both quality and comfort in underwear, I can confidently say that these boxer briefs exceed expectations on all fronts.First and foremost, the material is incredibly soft and breathable, thanks to the high-quality cotton construction. Whether I'm going about my daily activities or engaged in more rigorous exercise, these boxer briefs provide the comfort and support I need without feeling restrictive or uncomfortable.The ComfortFlex waistband is another standout feature of these boxer briefs. It provides a snug yet flexible fit that stays in place throughout the day, eliminating the need for constant adjustments. This waistband design ensures a secure and comfortable fit, no matter the activity or movement.One of the aspects I appreciate most about these boxer briefs is their durability. Despite regular wear and wash cycles, they hold up exceptionally well, maintaining their shape and elasticity over time. This durability speaks to the quality craftsmanship that Hanes is known for, making these boxer briefs a reliable investment in long-term comfort.The multipack offering is a convenient option, providing multiple pairs of boxer briefs in one purchase. This ensures that I always have a fresh pair available when needed, without having to constantly restock my underwear drawer.In terms of value, Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs offer excellent bang for your buck. The combination of comfort, durability, and affordability makes them a standout choice for anyone in search of reliable everyday underwear.Overall, I highly recommend Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs to anyone in need of comfortable and dependable underwear. From the soft cotton material to the ComfortFlex waistband and long-lasting durability, these boxer briefs check all the boxes for comfort and quality. Say goodbye to discomfort and hello to all-day comfort with Hanes.",
        "I have been a faithful user of briefs, but now I have switched to boxer briefs due to my inquisitive purchase of these Hanes boxers. I like their comfortable fit and the breathable materials. The waistbands are wide and very flexible, affording a pleasant fit and no rolling of the band itself into the waist and pinching. So, far (after several washes), they hold their color and have very little shrinkage. Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs are top-notch in design, comfort, and usefulness. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase was the cost. I think that it is a little high for underwear, but after doing some research, I found out that the cost of underwear is going up across the board with many manufacturers. With that said, Hanes Boxer Briefs are well worth their cost.",
        "I'm happy with the Hanes boxer briefs 12 pack. Decent price, good fit.  My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the sizing. I have a 35 inch waist, so I was undecided whether to get size Medium or Large. Large is advertised as fitting a 36 to 38 inch waist.  Small is 32-34. If size Large is appropriate for someone with a 38 inch waist, it sounded like they'd be too big, so I bought size Medium locally, and they were definitely too small. You can't return underwear after the package has been opened, so I ended up paying twice to get underwear that fits. I donated the size M to a clothing drive.  I'm pleased with the underwear.  However, if you have a size 38 waist, I don't think you'd be happy with size Large.",
        "These fits great and very comfortableRight size right priceVery pleased",
        "Hubby is a large, they fit him perfectly and look comfortable and nice. The colors are nice too and they aren't fading in the wash at all.",
        "These fit well. Great value. Super comfortable. Can\u2019t miss.",
        "These babies keep my babies warm in the winter and cool in the summer. They also don't tear as easy like other brands do whenever my woman is in the \"mood\". They pull down rather easy and don't get well \"hung\" up when I'm standing at attention and she's trying to rip them off in a hurry in the bathroom of the local Chili's. They're soft on the chile too. Normally, I go commando but on special occasions like a date night out to Chili's, I'll wear them just for the adventure of feeling like I'm actually playing hard to get. I recommend them.",
        "I would say it is comfortable which is really good about it. But I guess it is not made for short people - it is long. Which is fine by me. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable underwear. go for this one!",
        "Al verlos pens\u00e9 que eran m\u00e1s chicos que ma talla que ped\u00ed, de inicio quedan un poco apretados pero el material empieza a aflojarse con el uso como toda prenda. Son c\u00f3modos y la calidad es buena.",
        "Love the colors, great valueHubby says they're comfy.RecommendedTrue to size",
        "Great value and nice product.",
        "I finally made the switch from briefs to boxers. These are the second pack of boxer briefs that I've tried.I find briefs are good at holding the equipment comfortably, but restrict the air and blood flow.Boxers allow the equipment to hang free, but also allow the occasional dribble down the leg, and ride up.These boxer briefs are a great compromise incorporating the best of both worlds, whilst eliminating the worst of both worlds.They are comfortable to wear. They allow the equipment freedom to move, but the tighter leg fit prevents dribbles and don't ride up or wrap around as loose boxers do.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The material if soft and thick enough to absorb the occasional drip. They are comfortable, and don't ride up at all. The price is also pretty good.I would definitely recommend these boxer briefs.",
        "Good quality / flexible boxer briefs, only negative for me is that they are a tad longer than I normally like, but this is a good deal. They are snug fit and do not bunch up. I like the design and color of this pack. Would recommend / buy again."

        "The Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Crew T-Shirt is a comfortable and reliable choice for everyday wear. The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and is breathable, making it suitable for various activities.One of the standout features of this T-shirt is its design, which includes a crew neck and a stay-in-place fit. I've found that the neckline retains its shape wash after wash, and the overall fit is true to size.The T-shirt is versatile and can be worn on its own or layered under other clothing. The classic design makes it easy to pair with different outfits, whether for casual or more dressed-up occasions.I appreciate the durability of this T-shirt, as it has held up well through multiple washes without losing its shape or color. The fabric also maintains its softness, even after repeated laundering.",
        "This review is for a 6-pack of Fruit of the Loom, White Medium T-Shirts. I've been buying/wearing this brand of T-Shirts for as long as I can remember. These are high quality (very soft 100% cotton), exceptionally comfortable T-Shirts, which fit me well and have a generous length (so no pulling out from my pants). Fabric is smooth to the touch, and not at all itchy. The fabric and stitching appear heavy duty and it looks like these T-Shirts should last several years. After several cycles of wearing, washing & drying, I've not noticed any shrinkage, creasing, discoloration, unraveling or tearing. At Amazon's price, these were a best value and a very good deal. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!",
        "Why I spent most of my life buying white undershirts is beyond me. These are great undershirts and resist staining better than your typical white one. I like the fact they are longer, so they stay tucked in. I typically buy one size smaller than I would a typical t-shirt, so they are snug and don't bunch up with the overshirt. The price is also right compared to the many other options on Amazon. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable undershirt, these are the ones. :)",
        "I liked the product. Good fit , nice",
        "Good price on 6 pack of t shirts. I use black for work. Washed up nice, and feels nice on the skin. A little big, but not  to big for size.",
        "I purchased these in men's small for my 13 year old twin boys.  They shrink a bit after washing, and are a perfect fit.  They use them primarily for pajama shirts, but sometimes also as undershirts.  They are soft and tag-free, so they like these shirts.  I would just say they run a little small, as in most shirts, they are Youth L or sometimes XL.",
        "They\u2019re soft and material does not feel \u201ccheap\u201d. They actually feel a little thicker - not super thin like other brands. They are generously sized - not short like some can run. I would definitely purchase again and recommend.",
        "Very comfortable. Fits to size. Long enough to tuck in. Good buy!!!",
        "Extra length is good enough to fit around my large stomach and still stayed tucked into my pants. Good quality. Comfortable. Material is thick enough to be warm, but not too thick. Got them for a good price. Expect many years of use as a good undershirt.",
        "El material es muy suave y te permite transpirar. La medida excelente en M\u00e9xico.",
        "Excelentes playeras, bien c\u00f3modas y buen material 100% recomendadas",

        "I love Fruit of the Loom 100% cotton white T-shirts. I have probably bought more than a hundred of them for the last 15 years, mainly as work undershirts. Also, at home, there\u2019s nothing like wearing a 100% cotton, soft and comfy shirt for all seasons. I usually buy these from Walmart, so it's my first time buying Fruit of the Loom T-shirts  from Amazon. It\u2019s also my first time buying in multi-color.Yes, I have read the reviews advising me to buy one size up, especially because of shrinkage after laundry. I was so stubborn I did not listen. I ordered my usual medium size, only to realize I indeed should have listened to the previous reviewers. I ended up returning the medium size and buying one size up for me \u2013 the large size.Anyway, I am so happy that out of the 6 large T-shirts delivered, five of them are 100% cotton. The heather gray is 90% cotton and 10% polyester, but it still feels like almost 100% cotton, so I can\u2019t complain. These are so comfortable and perfect for all seasons (paired with a sweater, of course, during winter).Prompt delivery, no damage or defects, soft and comfortable, value for money, and environmentally friendly packaging \u2013 I would definitely buy again. It is five stars for sure."

        "Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs have been a game-changer in my daily comfort and wearability. As someone who prioritizes both quality and comfort in underwear, I can confidently say that these boxer briefs exceed expectations on all fronts.First and foremost, the material is incredibly soft and breathable, thanks to the high-quality cotton construction. Whether I'm going about my daily activities or engaged in more rigorous exercise, these boxer briefs provide the comfort and support I need without feeling restrictive or uncomfortable.The ComfortFlex waistband is another standout feature of these boxer briefs. It provides a snug yet flexible fit that stays in place throughout the day, eliminating the need for constant adjustments. This waistband design ensures a secure and comfortable fit, no matter the activity or movement.One of the aspects I appreciate most about these boxer briefs is their durability. Despite regular wear and wash cycles, they hold up exceptionally well, maintaining their shape and elasticity over time. This durability speaks to the quality craftsmanship that Hanes is known for, making these boxer briefs a reliable investment in long-term comfort.The multipack offering is a convenient option, providing multiple pairs of boxer briefs in one purchase. This ensures that I always have a fresh pair available when needed, without having to constantly restock my underwear drawer.In terms of value, Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs offer excellent bang for your buck. The combination of comfort, durability, and affordability makes them a standout choice for anyone in search of reliable everyday underwear.Overall, I highly recommend Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs to anyone in need of comfortable and dependable underwear. From the soft cotton material to the ComfortFlex waistband and long-lasting durability, these boxer briefs check all the boxes for comfort and quality. Say goodbye to discomfort and hello to all-day comfort with Hanes.",
        "I have been a faithful user of briefs, but now I have switched to boxer briefs due to my inquisitive purchase of these Hanes boxers. I like their comfortable fit and the breathable materials. The waistbands are wide and very flexible, affording a pleasant fit and no rolling of the band itself into the waist and pinching. So, far (after several washes), they hold their color and have very little shrinkage. Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs are top-notch in design, comfort, and usefulness. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase was the cost. I think that it is a little high for underwear, but after doing some research, I found out that the cost of underwear is going up across the board with many manufacturers. With that said, Hanes Boxer Briefs are well worth their cost.",
        "I'm happy with the Hanes boxer briefs 12 pack. Decent price, good fit.  My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the sizing. I have a 35 inch waist, so I was undecided whether to get size Medium or Large. Large is advertised as fitting a 36 to 38 inch waist.  Small is 32-34. If size Large is appropriate for someone with a 38 inch waist, it sounded like they'd be too big, so I bought size Medium locally, and they were definitely too small. You can't return underwear after the package has been opened, so I ended up paying twice to get underwear that fits. I donated the size M to a clothing drive.  I'm pleased with the underwear.  However, if you have a size 38 waist, I don't think you'd be happy with size Large.",
        "These fits great and very comfortableRight size right priceVery pleased",
        "Hubby is a large, they fit him perfectly and look comfortable and nice. The colors are nice too and they aren't fading in the wash at all.",
        "These fit well. Great value. Super comfortable. Can\u2019t miss.",
        "These babies keep my babies warm in the winter and cool in the summer. They also don't tear as easy like other brands do whenever my woman is in the \"mood\". They pull down rather easy and don't get well \"hung\" up when I'm standing at attention and she's trying to rip them off in a hurry in the bathroom of the local Chili's. They're soft on the chile too. Normally, I go commando but on special occasions like a date night out to Chili's, I'll wear them just for the adventure of feeling like I'm actually playing hard to get. I recommend them.",
        "I would say it is comfortable which is really good about it. But I guess it is not made for short people - it is long. Which is fine by me. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable underwear. go for this one!",
        "Al verlos pens\u00e9 que eran m\u00e1s chicos que ma talla que ped\u00ed, de inicio quedan un poco apretados pero el material empieza a aflojarse con el uso como toda prenda. Son c\u00f3modos y la calidad es buena.",
        "Love the colors, great valueHubby says they're comfy.RecommendedTrue to size",
        "Great value and nice product.",
        "I finally made the switch from briefs to boxers. These are the second pack of boxer briefs that I've tried.I find briefs are good at holding the equipment comfortably, but restrict the air and blood flow.Boxers allow the equipment to hang free, but also allow the occasional dribble down the leg, and ride up.These boxer briefs are a great compromise incorporating the best of both worlds, whilst eliminating the worst of both worlds.They are comfortable to wear. They allow the equipment freedom to move, but the tighter leg fit prevents dribbles and don't ride up or wrap around as loose boxers do.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The material if soft and thick enough to absorb the occasional drip. They are comfortable, and don't ride up at all. The price is also pretty good.I would definitely recommend these boxer briefs.",
        "Good quality / flexible boxer briefs, only negative for me is that they are a tad longer than I normally like, but this is a good deal. They are snug fit and do not bunch up. I like the design and color of this pack. Would recommend / buy again."

The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and is breathable, making it suitable for various activities.One of the standout features of this T-shirt is its design, which includes a crew neck and a stay-in-place fit. I've found that the neckline retains its shape wash after wash, and the overall fit is true to size.The T-shirt is versatile and can be worn on its own or layered under other clothing. The classic design makes it easy to pair with different outfits, whether for casual or more dressed-up occasions.I appreciate the durability of this T-shirt, as it has held up well through multiple washes without losing its shape or color. The fabric also maintains its softness, even after repeated laundering.",
        "This review is for a 6-pack of Fruit of the Loom, White Medium T-Shirts. I've been buying/wearing this brand of T-Shirts for as long as I can remember. These are high quality (very soft 100% cotton), exceptionally comfortable T-Shirts, which fit me well and have a generous length (so no pulling out from my pants). Fabric is smooth to the touch, and not at all itchy. The fabric and stitching appear heavy duty and it looks like these T-Shirts should last several years. After several cycles of wearing, washing & drying, I've not noticed any shrinkage, creasing, discoloration, unraveling or tearing. At Amazon's price, these were a best value and a very good deal. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!",
        "Why I spent most of my life buying white undershirts is beyond me. These are great undershirts and resist staining better than your typical white one. I like the fact they are longer, so they stay tucked in. I typically buy one size smaller than I would a typical t-shirt, so they are snug and don't bunch up with the overshirt. The price is also right compared to the many other options on Amazon. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable undershirt, these are the ones. :)",

They use them primarily for pajama shirts, but sometimes also as undershirts.  They are soft and tag-free, so they like these shirts.  I would just say they run a little small, as in most shirts, they are Youth L or sometimes XL.",
        "They\u2019re soft and material does not feel \u201ccheap\u201d. They actually feel a little thicker - not super thin like other brands. They are generously sized - not short like some can run. I would definitely purchase again and recommend.",

        "Extra length is good enough to fit around my large stomach and still stayed tucked into my pants. Good quality. Comfortable. Material is thick enough to be warm, but not too thick. Got them for a good price. Expect many years of use as a good undershirt.",

Also, at home, there\u2019s nothing like wearing a 100% cotton, soft and comfy shirt for all seasons. I usually buy these from Walmart, so it's my first time buying Fruit of the Loom T-shirts  from Amazon. It\u2019s also my first time buying in multi-color.Yes, I have read the reviews advising me to buy one size up, especially because of shrinkage after laundry. I was so stubborn I did not listen. I ordered my usual medium size, only to realize I indeed should have listened to the previous reviewers. I ended up returning the medium size and buying one size up for me \u2013 the large size.Anyway, I am so happy that out of the 6 large T-shirts delivered, five of them are 100% cotton. The heather gray is 90% cotton and 10% polyester, but it still feels like almost 100% cotton, so I can\u2019t complain. These are so comfortable and perfect for all seasons (paired with a sweater, of course, during winter).Prompt delivery, no damage or defects, soft and comfortable, value for money, and environmentally friendly packaging \u2013 I would definitely buy again. It is five stars for sure."

The heather gray is 90% cotton and 10% polyester, but it still feels like almost 100% cotton, so I can\u2019t complain. These are so comfortable and perfect for all seasons (paired with a sweater, of course, during winter).Prompt delivery, no damage or defects, soft and comfortable, value for money, and environmentally friendly packaging \u2013 I would definitely buy again. It is five stars for sure."

The fit is just right \u2013 not too tight and not too loose, making it perfect for casual outings or as an everyday undershirt.Durability is another strong point of these t-shirts.

This is especially important for a pack of five, as you want your investment to last.One of the standout features of these Gildan Crew T-Shirts is the affordability. You get five quality shirts for a reasonable price, making it an excellent value for your money. It's an economical way to replenish your basic t-shirt collection without breaking the bank.However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks to consider. The shirts tend to wrinkle easily, so you may need to give them a quick iron before wearing if you want a more polished look. Additionally, the color options in the pack are somewhat limited, which may not suit those looking for a wide range of choices.",
        "Exactly what I needed for basic wardrobe staples. 5 for under $30? Can't go wrong! The colours are good and go with most of the rest of my wardrobe, shirts fit well and don't look boxy or weird. No loose threads or deformities noticed. Seams are minimal and not annoying, no uncomfortable tags in the back. Just a good solid pack of basic tees to keep in rotation.",
        "These are great basic tees.  The fit is good, loose but not baggy, and the material feels great.  Can wear on its own or under sweater.  Overall good value for the price.",

        "I recently purchased a few pairs of Hanes Men's Tagless Boxers, and I have been absolutely thrilled with the comfort and quality they offer. These boxers have truly exceeded my expectations in every way.First and foremost, the tagless design is a game-changer. I no longer have to deal with irritating tags scratching against my skin throughout the day. Hanes has clearly listened to its customers and addressed this issue brilliantly.The fit of these boxers is superb. They provide just the right amount of support without feeling restrictive. The waistband stays in place, so there's no constant readjusting needed. Plus, the leg openings are comfortable and don't ride up, ensuring a snug but not constricting fit.The fabric is soft and breathable, making them ideal for all-day wear. Whether you're at work, hitting the gym, or simply lounging at home, these boxers keep you feeling comfortable and fresh. They also hold up well after multiple washes, which is a testament to their durability.I appreciate the variety of colors and patterns available, allowing me to choose boxers that match my style. It's the little things like this that make Hanes stand out.In summary, Hanes Men's Tagless Boxers have become my go-to choice for underwear. They combine comfort, quality, and style seamlessly. If you're looking for a reliable and comfortable pair of boxers, I wholeheartedly recommend giving these a try. You won't be disappointed!",
        "Comfortable just as pictured. Use measurements exactly provided and you'll be fine. Usually use large but went with measurements and got a M and they fit perfect. Quality is good too when received.",
        "I am very pleased with the fit of these boxers but be warned as others are reviewing as well; Buy the next size up from what you normally wear.  Briefs would be a size medium for me, but I need a large size for these boxers.  For whatever the reason, this seems to be the case with these boxers.  They're lightweight and comfortable.  You'll be able to dance wearing these boxers because you'll have plenty of ball-room.I like the tartan pattern and the colors are nice.  I bought 3 bundles so I don't have to do laundry so often.",
        "A great boxer if you don\u2019t need anything luxurious.  Great go to product, it\u2019s also well made.  The variations of the plaid are nice and the tagless interior ensures comfort.  Fits true to size.  Nothing fancy, very utilitarian.  Would purchase again.  Easy transaction!",

        "Very comfortable an a nice price",
        "These boxers are great. I bought these for my husband as a gift and he loves them. They are very comfortable and has great leg room. Very soft around the waistline and legs. He really likes that they are tags less too. I highly recommend these boxers.",
        "As a woman, I have found these to be my go-to underwear choice. For many years, I was satisfied with Hanes Woman's \"boyshorts,\" but their design change made them shorter and tighter, which I didn't prefer. Being a size 12, I wanted something that wasn't skimpy. That's when I discovered these underwear, and they have been a perfect fit for my primarily relaxed and lounge wear wardrobe.The exposed waistband eliminates any bulk at the waistline, but, the thin fabric does tend to bunch up or \u201cballoon\u201d under the waistband. But, this little hitch does not bother me. If I was trying to wear jeans or tighter profile clothes it might. I've had one set for almost two years, and they still look great. To avoid frequent washing, I decided to purchase a second set.Finding underwear with an exposed band style at a lower price point and with this material has been challenging, but these underwear meet all my requirements. Additionally, I love the plaids and colors available, with blue being my favorite color these are great. The patterns in this collection are appealing and I think have a more gender-neutral lookI buy the size Medium and I weigh 137 pounds. I wash these in warm water and dry on medium heat. I have not experienced any fading or shrinkage. In the hot summer months and I am hanging alone at home I wear these with a tshirt and feel comfortable if a friend pops by.

        "Antes de comprar el producto me d\u00ed a la tarea de leer otros comentarios de otros compradores... los cuales se quejaban por que la apertura de la entrepierna no contaba con ning\u00fan bot\u00f3n de seguridad, para evitar que saliera.La verdad es que a mi eso me pudo haber importado menos... Creo que no se necesita el bot\u00f3n y en cambio los patrones de tela me llamaron mucho la atenci\u00f3n... Recuerden que est\u00e1n comprando ropa interior con patrones de tela escosesas. Pero con colores modernos. La verdad es que quede muy satisfecho con mi compra. Recomiendo que observen bien las medidas y las tallas. Por fortuna para mi no es el primer rodeo, en cuanto a compras en l\u00ednea se refiere. Saludos a todos.",
        "I love the comfort of these and was so happy they're finally offered in more patterns, especially the checkered pattern! Unfortunately only the black/red is 100% cotton, and while the other is totally comfortable and useable, the fabric is a bit rougher. I prefer the 100% cotton versions of these boxers.",

The durability is impressive too; they've held up well after several washes. Great value for a multipack. Highly recommend for both work and casual wear!",
        "This version of the sock has a higher percentage of polyester (vs cotton in some other versions) and so the fit in the same size is a bit larger, the foot is a bit looser, and there is not the arch support feature that is in the higher percentage cotton socks, something we like, but can these were bought for sleeping and wearing around the house, and not working or working out, so that's okay.Since these are more polyester, they also dry very quickly, there will be less shrinkage, and the dreaded endless tufts of material will not be featured either. We do wash these in cold or warm, quick low dry, inside out.NOTE: due to the higher polyester, these will pick up a higher electrical charge if you walk around in yoru socks on carpets. Beware of your pup's nose! Also, they have snagged on some shoes, also due to the polyester and less cotton.We would get these again, bearing in mind the above, and that they would *not* be works socks. These lack the support and firmness I need when on my feet in boots all day. I use other Dickies for that.",
        "What can I say -- these are socks. I normally keep a drawer full of medium-length black socks, which will do for business dress occasions as well as casual wear and yardwork. These handily cover all three areas -- they look nice enough to wear where others can see, but they're sturdy and comfortable enough for an afternoon of sweaty work under the Florida sun. Decent cushioning, and strong enough elastic that they have yet to sag. The material is holding up under constant washing. These are the things I need from a sock.I like that the foot portion has a color pattern that clearly shows the top and bottom in the semi-dark when you're getting dressed. A few months in, they're holding up great, and I'll probably order more when I need them.- Five stars for these sock stars.",
        "This sock does everything it advertises. Nice toe box to avoid squishing the toes, good support in arch without being tight. Keeps feet really dry. Material has a soothing comfort to it. Ahhhh... finally a sock I enjoy wearing.",

I wanted some cute sweatpants because it's starting to get really cold and I HATE women's sweatpants and Tshirts! I buy men's in both because they are cheaper and just look and feel much better. I had a hard time figuring out my size and bought 4 different pairs in different sizes and brands trying to find the ones that fit and that I liked the most. I had a hard time because I couldn't find anyone my weight and height that had written a review so I went by what Amazon \"recommended \" an XL. (Different brand) I definitely hesitated because I know these are mens sweatpants  so they are going to be bigger. I went back and forth between a L or XL. I got the XL first in this other brand and they were WAYYY TOO BIG!! Then I got a L still too big and I didn't want to deal with the hassle of trying to return them so I gave them to my husband but anyway I then found this brand and went with a Medium and I was scared they would be too small because I chose these instead of the other brand I mentioned and wasn'tsure if these ran smaller than the first brand. But I got them yesterday and they fit AMAZING!! Like I'm obsessed..I know they are just sweatpants but I'm a girl who loves comfort and wears tshirts and sweatpants or leggings almost always! Sorry for rambling on and on and going all over the place in this review..now for the most important part of my review for others having a hard time picking the right size..I am 5'2 and 170ish pounds. I usually wear a large or Xl in bottoms. I have pretty thick thighs and a good sized bottom and these fit me really well so if your my size I would go with a medium and be careful following Amazon's size recommendations because more often than not it's been off for me.

I wouldn\u2019t take long before they start to fall apart so I returned them for a replacement.  The other thing to take not of is that things like phones and wallets don\u2019t stay in the pockets when you sit down.  I got into the store and my wallet was missing and I found it in the car on the seat as it has fallen out.  At my son\u2019s house after watching my grandchildren he picked up my wallet and phone from the easy chair and handed them to me.

You might want to throw it in the dryer a couple times and let the lint catcher at it for a while cuz this thing sheds a bunch of little black bits all over in the first couple weeksOtherwise, it's pants, it works, it's adequately warm and pretty comfy",

You might want to throw it in the dryer a couple times and let the lint catcher at it for a while cuz this thing sheds a bunch of little black bits all over in the first couple weeksOtherwise, it's pants, it works, it's adequately warm and pretty comfy",

I live in an area where it's usually below -10 Celsius in winter and I can take the dog for a walk in these without worry.  They're comfy, fit well, I'll definitely be buying these again.",

The comfort level of these boxer briefs is unmatched, thanks to the soft, breathable cotton fabric that feels great against the skin. The fit is just right, offering ample support without being too tight, and the longer length prevents chafing. The waistband doesn't dig in, providing an all-day comfortable wear.

        "Removed from packaging same day they arrived. Washed a couple of days later. All our clothes are washed in cold water, dried in a low heat dryer. Shrank at least a size. Do not hold their shape. Tried wearing 1 pair, couldn't get through a day of wear.",
        "Good fit in the am but a bit lacking by afternoon.  Will tend too bunch up in the tender bits region.  Leg opening kind of stretch out allowing for ride up.  But they feel good in the morning.",
        "I do like that these work for a larger man and the big man sizes great if a man has bigger thighs, or if he\u2019s not an Abercrombie model and a real man size with a real man waste their breathable there comfortable around the thighs per my husband they\u2019re great underwear they\u2019re breathable they\u2019re fashionable they\u2019re nice they come in great colors they\u2019re comfortable But definitely overpriced. I just don\u2019t understand why the prices so much probably because they know they can charge so much what we really need is a more reasonable and wear in socks for men instead of them being overpriced but yes, I would suggest purchasing these, if you have a  Need for great underwear plus if you buy the big man size like myself, for example, like my husband who is a police officer who has very large arms and legs, but in this situation, we\u2019re talking about his thighs because he works out and he\u2019s  a large muscular person. And again you don\u2019t have to be muscular you can be overweight but regardless if you have big legs, the big man size of this brand is the way to go. I purchased three XL the first time but they were just way too large so I ordered two XL this time and it works great so they\u2019re definitely true to the size.",
        "This is the third time I have bought these for my husband. He loves them because they are slightly snug but still breathable. The sizing guide was spot on. He does a ton of walking at work so they do eventually get holes around the crotch region but it takes him about a year to wear out a pack of twelve. A great buy for the price.",
        "Last minute order for my teenage son , it fits great and arrived right on time for our trip. Will definitely buy again and recommend.",
        "To be honest these are expensive, but they are definitely one of best boxer briefs I have.They are comfortable and fit snug on your waist and private area. I don\u2019t feel the need to stretch it out later in the day so I know they fit well. They are a good length, not short like others I have bought before.They wash fine as far as I can tell and haven\u2019t stained either. Overall it is a good quality product, again a bit expensive, I bought it for $20 but will last a while.Durability 4/5Comfort 4/5Price 3/5",

I just don\u2019t understand why the prices so much probably because they know they can charge so much what we really need is a more reasonable and wear in socks for men instead of them being overpriced but yes, I would suggest purchasing these, if you have a  Need for great underwear plus if you buy the big man size like myself, for example, like my husband who is a police officer who has very large arms and legs, but in this situation, we\u2019re talking about his thighs because he works out and he\u2019s  a large muscular person. And again you don\u2019t have to be muscular you can be overweight but regardless if you have big legs, the big man size of this brand is the way to go. I purchased three XL the first time but they were just way too large so I ordered two XL this time and it works great so they\u2019re definitely true to the size.",
        "This is the third time I have bought these for my husband. He loves them because they are slightly snug but still breathable. The sizing guide was spot on. He does a ton of walking at work so they do eventually get holes around the crotch region but it takes him about a year to wear out a pack of twelve. A great buy for the price.",
        "Last minute order for my teenage son , it fits great and arrived right on time for our trip. Will definitely buy again and recommend.",
        "To be honest these are expensive, but they are definitely one of best boxer briefs I have.They are comfortable and fit snug on your waist and private area. I don\u2019t feel the need to stretch it out later in the day so I know they fit well. They are a good length, not short like others I have bought before.They wash fine as far as I can tell and haven\u2019t stained either. Overall it is a good quality product, again a bit expensive, I bought it for $20 but will last a while.Durability 4/5Comfort 4/5Price 3/5",
        "Product is good quality and comfortable...but runs small.  30\" waste get a medium.",
        "Desde que prob\u00e9 est\u00e1 marca ya hace unos a\u00f1os no la he cambiado, son c\u00f3modos, resistentes y  a buen precio.",
        "Nice fit, good material and great price!",
        "La tela es muy suave estiran y se ajustan muy bien los recomiendo al 100 y el precio es lo mejor",
        "Gostei e voltaria a comprsr.",
        "Excelente calidad, son perfectos, justo como se ven."

        "Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs have been a game-changer in my daily comfort and wearability. As someone who prioritizes both quality and comfort in underwear, I can confidently say that these boxer briefs exceed expectations on all fronts.First and foremost, the material is incredibly soft and breathable, thanks to the high-quality cotton construction. Whether I'm going about my daily activities or engaged in more rigorous exercise, these boxer briefs provide the comfort and support I need without feeling restrictive or uncomfortable.The ComfortFlex waistband is another standout feature of these boxer briefs. It provides a snug yet flexible fit that stays in place throughout the day, eliminating the need for constant adjustments. This waistband design ensures a secure and comfortable fit, no matter the activity or movement.One of the aspects I appreciate most about these boxer briefs is their durability. Despite regular wear and wash cycles, they hold up exceptionally well, maintaining their shape and elasticity over time. This durability speaks to the quality craftsmanship that Hanes is known for, making these boxer briefs a reliable investment in long-term comfort.The multipack offering is a convenient option, providing multiple pairs of boxer briefs in one purchase. This ensures that I always have a fresh pair available when needed, without having to constantly restock my underwear drawer.In terms of value, Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs offer excellent bang for your buck. The combination of comfort, durability, and affordability makes them a standout choice for anyone in search of reliable everyday underwear.Overall, I highly recommend Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs to anyone in need of comfortable and dependable underwear. From the soft cotton material to the ComfortFlex waistband and long-lasting durability, these boxer briefs check all the boxes for comfort and quality. Say goodbye to discomfort and hello to all-day comfort with Hanes.",
        "I have been a faithful user of briefs, but now I have switched to boxer briefs due to my inquisitive purchase of these Hanes boxers. I like their comfortable fit and the breathable materials. The waistbands are wide and very flexible, affording a pleasant fit and no rolling of the band itself into the waist and pinching. So, far (after several washes), they hold their color and have very little shrinkage. Hanes Men's Boxer Briefs are top-notch in design, comfort, and usefulness. The only thing I didn't like about this purchase was the cost. I think that it is a little high for underwear, but after doing some research, I found out that the cost of underwear is going up across the board with many manufacturers. With that said, Hanes Boxer Briefs are well worth their cost.",
        "I'm happy with the Hanes boxer briefs 12 pack. Decent price, good fit.  My only reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the sizing. I have a 35 inch waist, so I was undecided whether to get size Medium or Large. Large is advertised as fitting a 36 to 38 inch waist.  Small is 32-34. If size Large is appropriate for someone with a 38 inch waist, it sounded like they'd be too big, so I bought size Medium locally, and they were definitely too small. You can't return underwear after the package has been opened, so I ended up paying twice to get underwear that fits. I donated the size M to a clothing drive.  I'm pleased with the underwear.  However, if you have a size 38 waist, I don't think you'd be happy with size Large.",
        "These fits great and very comfortableRight size right priceVery pleased",
        "Hubby is a large, they fit him perfectly and look comfortable and nice. The colors are nice too and they aren't fading in the wash at all.",
        "These fit well. Great value. Super comfortable. Can\u2019t miss.",
        "These babies keep my babies warm in the winter and cool in the summer. They also don't tear as easy like other brands do whenever my woman is in the \"mood\". They pull down rather easy and don't get well \"hung\" up when I'm standing at attention and she's trying to rip them off in a hurry in the bathroom of the local Chili's. They're soft on the chile too. Normally, I go commando but on special occasions like a date night out to Chili's, I'll wear them just for the adventure of feeling like I'm actually playing hard to get. I recommend them.",
        "I would say it is comfortable which is really good about it. But I guess it is not made for short people - it is long. Which is fine by me. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable underwear. go for this one!",
        "Al verlos pens\u00e9 que eran m\u00e1s chicos que ma talla que ped\u00ed, de inicio quedan un poco apretados pero el material empieza a aflojarse con el uso como toda prenda. Son c\u00f3modos y la calidad es buena.",
        "Love the colors, great valueHubby says they're comfy.RecommendedTrue to size",
        "Great value and nice product.",
        "I finally made the switch from briefs to boxers. These are the second pack of boxer briefs that I've tried.I find briefs are good at holding the equipment comfortably, but restrict the air and blood flow.Boxers allow the equipment to hang free, but also allow the occasional dribble down the leg, and ride up.These boxer briefs are a great compromise incorporating the best of both worlds, whilst eliminating the worst of both worlds.They are comfortable to wear. They allow the equipment freedom to move, but the tighter leg fit prevents dribbles and don't ride up or wrap around as loose boxers do.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The material if soft and thick enough to absorb the occasional drip. They are comfortable, and don't ride up at all. The price is also pretty good.I would definitely recommend these boxer briefs.",
        "Good quality / flexible boxer briefs, only negative for me is that they are a tad longer than I normally like, but this is a good deal. They are snug fit and do not bunch up. I like the design and color of this pack. Would recommend / buy again."

The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and is breathable, making it suitable for various activities.One of the standout features of this T-shirt is its design, which includes a crew neck and a stay-in-place fit. I've found that the neckline retains its shape wash after wash, and the overall fit is true to size.The T-shirt is versatile and can be worn on its own or layered under other clothing. The classic design makes it easy to pair with different outfits, whether for casual or more dressed-up occasions.I appreciate the durability of this T-shirt, as it has held up well through multiple washes without losing its shape or color. The fabric also maintains its softness, even after repeated laundering.",
        "This review is for a 6-pack of Fruit of the Loom, White Medium T-Shirts. I've been buying/wearing this brand of T-Shirts for as long as I can remember. These are high quality (very soft 100% cotton), exceptionally comfortable T-Shirts, which fit me well and have a generous length (so no pulling out from my pants). Fabric is smooth to the touch, and not at all itchy. The fabric and stitching appear heavy duty and it looks like these T-Shirts should last several years. After several cycles of wearing, washing & drying, I've not noticed any shrinkage, creasing, discoloration, unraveling or tearing. At Amazon's price, these were a best value and a very good deal. I'm very satisfied with my purchase!",
        "Why I spent most of my life buying white undershirts is beyond me. These are great undershirts and resist staining better than your typical white one. I like the fact they are longer, so they stay tucked in. I typically buy one size smaller than I would a typical t-shirt, so they are snug and don't bunch up with the overshirt. The price is also right compared to the many other options on Amazon. If you are looking for a cheap, comfortable undershirt, these are the ones. :)",

I would just say they run a little small, as in most shirts, they are Youth L or sometimes XL.",
        "They\u2019re soft and material does not feel \u201ccheap\u201d. They actually feel a little thicker - not super thin like other brands. They are generously sized - not short like some can run. I would definitely purchase again and recommend.",

I usually buy these from Walmart, so it's my first time buying Fruit of the Loom T-shirts  from Amazon. It\u2019s also my first time buying in multi-color.Yes, I have read the reviews advising me to buy one size up, especially because of shrinkage after laundry. I was so stubborn I did not listen.

I ended up returning the medium size and buying one size up for me \u2013 the large size.Anyway, I am so happy that out of the 6 large T-shirts delivered, five of them are 100% cotton. The heather gray is 90% cotton and 10% polyester, but it still feels like almost 100% cotton, so I can\u2019t complain. These are so comfortable and perfect for all seasons (paired with a sweater, of course, during winter).Prompt delivery, no damage or defects, soft and comfortable, value for money, and environmentally friendly packaging \u2013 I would definitely buy again.

        "We loved these t-shirts! We were a bit worried about the sizing because we didn't want them to be slim fit, but the size chart is true to size. We received gret quality cotton shirts, they look nice, they don't discolor and the material is soft and comfy.",
        "The Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts Multipack is a stellar blend of comfort, durability, and affordability. Crafted from a soft and breathable cotton blend, the shirts offer a cozy fit that remains comfortable even after multiple washes. The durability of the fabric and solid stitching ensure longevity, making these shirts a reliable investment. Their versatility shines through as they effortlessly transition from casual to slightly dressy occasions. What sets these shirts apart, however, is their unbeatable affordability. Providing multiple high-quality shirts in one pack at such a reasonable price makes them a standout choice for anyone seeking a budget-friendly yet reliable addition to their wardrobe. Overall, Gildan's multipack earns top marks for those who prioritize comfort, durability, and value for money.",
        "When I ordered these tshirts I was expecting to be returning them because they were priced low. Boy was I surprised they are very good quality and fit great!",
        "These are a great value and fit as expected.  The fabric isn't the softest cotton ever, but it's acceptable.  The only negative is the stitching is inconsistent (good on most, wonky on one, and a bad spot on one seam).For the price they're good.  And I have some old ones of these that I've had for a couple years and they've held up well (long as the stitching doesn't fail).  Wash after wash they never \"pill up\" or get threadworn.",
        "I'm 5' 11\", 170 lbs, 9-10% body fat with an athletic build. I wear size Medium.Finally a shirt I love. These shirts, and their identically-fitting V-necks, really are all I wear 95% of the time. I like the way the shirts feel, the way they fit and how they drape off of my upper body. Apart from the seldom loose string that needs cut, these are nicely made and a very good value for the price.A word of caution: these shirts will shrink quite a bit if you use hot water and/or a clothes dryer. I wash them in cold water and then hang dry. They hold their fit/length for a long time that way.",
        "My husband loves the quality, fit, color, and look of these shirts. They have maintained their quality, color, and fit. Haven't had any issues with washing and drying (no fading, no shrinking, etc). Would definitely buy these again.",
        "Definitely was a little skeptical first I have a tendency to be long wasted, but ended up getting the shirts and trying them on and they\u2019re exactly like their ad advertised. Definitely feel like good quality are nice and long which I like \u2026\u2026will  definitely buy again can\u2019t beat the price.",
        "5\u20199\u201d, 240lbs, 50\u201d chest, 38\u201d waist.Purchased XXL expecting them to shrink to proper size.

        "I recently purchased the Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts 5 pack, and I must say I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. These shirts have quickly become a staple in my wardrobe for several reasons.First and foremost, the comfort level is impressive. The cotton fabric feels soft against the skin and doesn't cause any irritation or discomfort, even after a full day of wear. The fit is just right \u2013 not too tight and not too loose, making it perfect for casual outings or as an everyday undershirt.Durability is another strong point of these t-shirts. I've washed them multiple times, and they have held up remarkably well, maintaining their shape and color without any noticeable shrinkage. This is especially important for a pack of five, as you want your investment to last.One of the standout features of these Gildan Crew T-Shirts is the affordability. You get five quality shirts for a reasonable price, making it an excellent value for your money. It's an economical way to replenish your basic t-shirt collection without breaking the bank.However, there are a couple of minor drawbacks to consider. The shirts tend to wrinkle easily, so you may need to give them a quick iron before wearing if you want a more polished look. Additionally, the color options in the pack are somewhat limited, which may not suit those looking for a wide range of choices.",
        "Exactly what I needed for basic wardrobe staples. 5 for under $30? Can't go wrong! The colours are good and go with most of the rest of my wardrobe, shirts fit well and don't look boxy or weird. No loose threads or deformities noticed. Seams are minimal and not annoying, no uncomfortable tags in the back. Just a good solid pack of basic tees to keep in rotation.",
        "These are great basic tees.  The fit is good, loose but not baggy, and the material feels great.  Can wear on its own or under sweater.  Overall good value for the price.",

        "We loved these t-shirts! We were a bit worried about the sizing because we didn't want them to be slim fit, but the size chart is true to size. We received gret quality cotton shirts, they look nice, they don't discolor and the material is soft and comfy.",
        "The Gildan Men's Crew T-Shirts Multipack is a stellar blend of comfort, durability, and affordability. Crafted from a soft and breathable cotton blend, the shirts offer a cozy fit that remains comfortable even after multiple washes. The durability of the fabric and solid stitching ensure longevity, making these shirts a reliable investment. Their versatility shines through as they effortlessly transition from casual to slightly dressy occasions. What sets these shirts apart, however, is their unbeatable affordability. Providing multiple high-quality shirts in one pack at such a reasonable price makes them a standout choice for anyone seeking a budget-friendly yet reliable addition to their wardrobe. Overall, Gildan's multipack earns top marks for those who prioritize comfort, durability, and value for money.",
        "When I ordered these tshirts I was expecting to be returning them because they were priced low. Boy was I surprised they are very good quality and fit great!",
        "These are a great value and fit as expected.  The fabric isn't the softest cotton ever, but it's acceptable.  The only negative is the stitching is inconsistent (good on most, wonky on one, and a bad spot on one seam).For the price they're good.  And I have some old ones of these that I've had for a couple years and they've held up well (long as the stitching doesn't fail).  Wash after wash they never \"pill up\" or get threadworn.",
        "I'm 5' 11\", 170 lbs, 9-10% body fat with an athletic build. I wear size Medium.Finally a shirt I love. These shirts, and their identically-fitting V-necks, really are all I wear 95% of the time. I like the way the shirts feel, the way they fit and how they drape off of my upper body. Apart from the seldom loose string that needs cut, these are nicely made and a very good value for the price.A word of caution: these shirts will shrink quite a bit if you use hot water and/or a clothes dryer. I wash them in cold water and then hang dry. They hold their fit/length for a long time that way.",
        "My husband loves the quality, fit, color, and look of these shirts. They have maintained their quality, color, and fit. Haven't had any issues with washing and drying (no fading, no shrinking, etc). Would definitely buy these again.",
        "Definitely was a little skeptical first I have a tendency to be long wasted, but ended up getting the shirts and trying them on and they\u2019re exactly like their ad advertised. Definitely feel like good quality are nice and long which I like \u2026\u2026will  definitely buy again can\u2019t beat the price.",

These boxers have truly exceeded my expectations in every way.First and foremost, the tagless design is a game-changer. I no longer have to deal with irritating tags scratching against my skin throughout the day. Hanes has clearly listened to its customers and addressed this issue brilliantly.The fit of these boxers is superb. They provide just the right amount of support without feeling restrictive. The waistband stays in place, so there's no constant readjusting needed. Plus, the leg openings are comfortable and don't ride up, ensuring a snug but not constricting fit.The fabric is soft and breathable, making them ideal for all-day wear. Whether you're at work, hitting the gym, or simply lounging at home, these boxers keep you feeling comfortable and fresh. They also hold up well after multiple washes, which is a testament to their durability.I appreciate the variety of colors and patterns available, allowing me to choose boxers that match my style. It's the little things like this that make Hanes stand out.In summary, Hanes Men's Tagless Boxers have become my go-to choice for underwear. They combine comfort, quality, and style seamlessly. If you're looking for a reliable and comfortable pair of boxers, I wholeheartedly recommend giving these a try. You won't be disappointed!",
        "Comfortable just as pictured. Use measurements exactly provided and you'll be fine. Usually use large but went with measurements and got a M and they fit perfect. Quality is good too when received.",
        "I am very pleased with the fit of these boxers but be warned as others are reviewing as well; Buy the next size up from what you normally wear.  Briefs would be a size medium for me, but I need a large size for these boxers.  For whatever the reason, this seems to be the case with these boxers.  They're lightweight and comfortable.  You'll be able to dance wearing these boxers because you'll have plenty of ball-room.I like the tartan pattern and the colors are nice.  I bought 3 bundles so I don't have to do laundry so often.",
        "A great boxer if you don\u2019t need anything luxurious.  Great go to product, it\u2019s also well made.  The variations of the plaid are nice and the tagless interior ensures comfort.  Fits true to size.  Nothing fancy, very utilitarian.  Would purchase again.  Easy transaction!",

        "As a woman, I have found these to be my go-to underwear choice. For many years, I was satisfied with Hanes Woman's \"boyshorts,\" but their design change made them shorter and tighter, which I didn't prefer. Being a size 12, I wanted something that wasn't skimpy. That's when I discovered these underwear, and they have been a perfect fit for my primarily relaxed and lounge wear wardrobe.The exposed waistband eliminates any bulk at the waistline, but, the thin fabric does tend to bunch up or \u201cballoon\u201d under the waistband. But, this little hitch does not bother me. If I was trying to wear jeans or tighter profile clothes it might. I've had one set for almost two years, and they still look great. To avoid frequent washing, I decided to purchase a second set.Finding underwear with an exposed band style at a lower price point and with this material has been challenging, but these underwear meet all my requirements. Additionally, I love the plaids and colors available, with blue being my favorite color these are great. The patterns in this collection are appealing and I think have a more gender-neutral lookI buy the size Medium and I weigh 137 pounds. I wash these in warm water and dry on medium heat. I have not experienced any fading or shrinkage. In the hot summer months and I am hanging alone at home I wear these with a tshirt and feel comfortable if a friend pops by.

We do wash these in cold or warm, quick low dry, inside out.NOTE: due to the higher polyester, these will pick up a higher electrical charge if you walk around in yoru socks on carpets. Beware of your pup's nose! Also, they have snagged on some shoes, also due to the polyester and less cotton.We would get these again, bearing in mind the above, and that they would *not* be works socks. These lack the support and firmness I need when on my feet in boots all day. I use other Dickies for that.",
        "What can I say -- these are socks. I normally keep a drawer full of medium-length black socks, which will do for business dress occasions as well as casual wear and yardwork. These handily cover all three areas -- they look nice enough to wear where others can see, but they're sturdy and comfortable enough for an afternoon of sweaty work under the Florida sun. Decent cushioning, and strong enough elastic that they have yet to sag. The material is holding up under constant washing. These are the things I need from a sock.I like that the foot portion has a color pattern that clearly shows the top and bottom in the semi-dark when you're getting dressed. A few months in, they're holding up great, and I'll probably order more when I need them.- Five stars for these sock stars.",
        "This sock does everything it advertises. Nice toe box to avoid squishing the toes, good support in arch without being tight. Keeps feet really dry. Material has a soothing comfort to it. Ahhhh... finally a sock I enjoy wearing.",

I wanted some cute sweatpants because it's starting to get really cold and I HATE women's sweatpants and Tshirts! I buy men's in both because they are cheaper and just look and feel much better. I had a hard time figuring out my size and bought 4 different pairs in different sizes and brands trying to find the ones that fit and that I liked the most. I had a hard time because I couldn't find anyone my weight and height that had written a review so I went by what Amazon \"recommended \" an XL. (Different brand) I definitely hesitated because I know these are mens sweatpants  so they are going to be bigger. I went back and forth between a L or XL. I got the XL first in this other brand and they were WAYYY TOO BIG!! Then I got a L still too big and I didn't want to deal with the hassle of trying to return them so I gave them to my husband but anyway I then found this brand and went with a Medium and I was scared they would be too small because I chose these instead of the other brand I mentioned and wasn'tsure if these ran smaller than the first brand.

I just don\u2019t understand why the prices so much probably because they know they can charge so much what we really need is a more reasonable and wear in socks for men instead of them being overpriced but yes, I would suggest purchasing these, if you have a  Need for great underwear plus if you buy the big man size like myself, for example, like my husband who is a police officer who has very large arms and legs, but in this situation, we\u2019re talking about his thighs because he works out and he\u2019s  a large muscular person. And again you don\u2019t have to be muscular you can be overweight but regardless if you have big legs, the big man size of this brand is the way to go.

They are a little thick too, but whether this is good or bad depends on your preference.However, the black ones shrink in the wash a little, and will lose some of their length. Not really noticable elsewhere, but I'm not sure why the grey ones didn't shrink when they're both supposed to be cotton.",
        "Decided to get these to start using as an undershirt for my work clothes. It\u2019s super comfortable and soft and definitely well made.

I would say a guy up to about 6'7 could fit the length of the tall selection here. They are roomy and big. My XLT could be a small XXLT. Maybe they will shrink a little bit but I am thrilled. They are super soft and I will wear outside too...gym...store..they are cool. Very soft. I got the blue and they look great. One heck of a value for two of them. XLT similar sleep pants even at Kohl's were like 35.00 a pair. This is a great value here. Big and Tall guys rejoice we found a great deal on Amazon.",
        "The product accurately lives up to its description. I was drawn to these pants due to the combination of brand recognition and an affordable price point. Fruit of the Loom offered two pairs of lounge pants for a reasonable $36.99, which was quite appealing.Upon receiving the product, I immediately tried them on to assess the fit. I was pleased to find that they matched the stated sizing perfectly. Following this, I washed the two pairs of pants, as I always prefer to launder new clothing before wearing it.The black color of the pants held up well to washing, demonstrating excellent colorfastness without any signs of fading. Additionally, there was no noticeable shrinkage, which was a great relief.Wearing the pants throughout the day proved to be a comfortable experience. The fabric is soft and lightweight, with a reasonable stretch that eliminates any concerns about tearing during sleep. These pants serve well for various activities, including sleep, lounging, and even running errands. I feel that I received excellent value for the price paid!",
        "So glad I ordered these leisure pants that came in a set.  I purchased the blue and black pants - goes with everything to relax in.Soft fabric, not too thick, easy to relax in.  Pockets are a plus.  Fit was perfect. Pleased with this purchase.",
        "These are wonderful, soft, light, breathable and warm sleep pants.  It is so hard to find good quality 100% cotton clothes these days -- these are great.  One caution, especially for taller people:  they will shrink several inches lengthwise the first time you wash and dry them.  I am 6' 1\" and usually I don't need to get \"tall\" sizes in clothes, but for these, it was essential.  Regular large ended up being above my ankles, but Large Tall was perfect.",
        "It's Always Good To Have A HAPPY HUSBAND! My husband is really fussy about what he wears for Sleep PJs and these didn't disappoint! The fit was perfect, super comfortable, accommodating (pockets), elastic waist with a tie (no slipping down or discomfort at any level), and the material isn't too thick or too thin.  No stepping on the back of your PJs. These would be comfy year-round and as solids, they can be worn around the yard for quick trips to the barn or as needed. \"You get what you pay for\" is so true about these. Quality with a good feel, wash and dry nicely, no shrinkage. WHY LOOK ELSEWHERE? Fruit of the Loom is a name you can count on. It's disappointing that they are no longer made in the USA but the quality doesn't appear to suffer.  We were able to get these using \"TRY IT NOW\" and it didn't take long to realize they were perfect. I've already paid for these and have added them to the list for a couple more pairs or packs of 2. In a world where shopping online for clothes can be difficult, these won't disappoint.  Fast shipping!!! Bought them on Nov 6th and received them on Nov 7th! It doesn't get better than that! Buy with confidence and give us a LIKE! LoL",

        "Looks good for lounging around at home. Very soft and comfortable. Runs big. Ordered an XL regular as recommended by Amazon based on my past orders and others orders. I'm 5'8\" 180 pounds. Pants run big. 4 inches in waist and 6 inches in leg on me.. Wow. Checked tag to make sure it wasn't a Big and Tall sent by mistake. It wasn't. Based on my experience I would size down.

This shirt shrinks to a nice length that hits just below the beltline \u2014 which is really ideal for my torso. So I'm very happy. If you are tall, you might have a different opinion though.Arms are flatteringly snug and look tailored \u2014 not like big gaping thingsMy only complaint is that the collar sits oddly high behind the neck.",

I\u2019d get it dry cleaned so the collars don\u2019t get ruined in the washing machine and dryer since it doesn\u2019t come with collar stays. The slim fit looks great and it\u2019s quite comfortable as well. Highly recommend! I\u2019ll be buying more colors!",
        "The overall fit is okay, so I'll keep it. I tried the \"regular fit\" but that was more like \"HUGE/MASSIVELY-FAT fit\". The \"slim fit\" is more like what I'd consider \"regular fit\".But the sleeves SUCK. These shirts are NOT made for physically active people who need allowance for UPWARD OR FOREWARD ARM MOVEMENT. It's as if they're made just for people who just go around with their hands in their pockets all day long. The sleeves on this shirt \u2014 and just about every other so-called \"modern\" polo you can get these days \u2014 are very restrictive of ANY kind of arm movement. I've uploaded a photo to compare this shirt with an older shirt I have. You can see that it's VERY tight in the armpits and across the upper arm, not like they appear in the product photos, but the photos don't show models with their arms raised \u2014 I wonder why?The fabric is soft and comfortable, but also weak and flimsy compared to the REAL polos I used to wear when they first came into vogue, that I used to buy in this price range (allowing for inflation). If I ever find a clothing brand that brings back a real classic polo, I'm going to buy a truckload of them. I miss them.",

        "Good product considering the price.  Fabric is a decent weight.  Construction is good, collar fits well.  Good deep colour, still in good shape after several washes.  Shirt tails are long enough for tucking in, but shirt can be worn untucked.  Will definitely buy again.",

They\u2019re not too low or too high in the rise so they work great under jeans, shorts, gym wear, anything.  The pouch is roomy but supportive and never feels constricting or too tight.  The coverage in the butt is perfect and not cut too high.  The true testament is that I can sleep in them.  I usually can\u2019t sleep in briefs of any kind so that\u2019s when I knew these were keepers.  Best of all they\u2019re a great value and made well.

        "My dear man wears these Hanes tagless briefs. We cannot find them in our area (we are in a retail desert), hence our go-to is Amazon. Great price, pack of 9 is a great buy. They are perfectly white, so if bleach is needed in the wash, no worries. They hold up well, delivered on time, we have purchased from this supplier multiple times, no issues. Will keep using this supplier with confidence.",
        "These are hands down my favorite briefs ever.  I\u2019ve been a long time briefs wearer and have tried so many brands, cuts/styles, fabrics and honestly none of those compare to the fit, comfort and appeal of these classic Hanes.  They\u2019re not too low or too high in the rise so they work great under jeans, shorts, gym wear, anything.  The pouch is roomy but supportive and never feels constricting or too tight.  The coverage in the butt is perfect and not cut too high.  The true testament is that I can sleep in them.  I usually can\u2019t sleep in briefs of any kind so that\u2019s when I knew these were keepers.  Best of all they\u2019re a great value and made well.

        "I got these to wear under my shirts for work so my suspenders don't rub on my skin. They do the job, and are comfy and stretchy. They are a little thick too, but whether this is good or bad depends on your preference.However, the black ones shrink in the wash a little, and will lose some of their length. Not really noticable elsewhere, but I'm not sure why the grey ones didn't shrink when they're both supposed to be cotton.",
        "Decided to get these to start using as an undershirt for my work clothes. It\u2019s super comfortable and soft and definitely well made. They have lasted me a long time and through many wash cycles this far. Highly recommend for an easy undershirt to wear or something around the house when you\u2019re too lazy to wear a full shirt.",

The items had 2 standard labels each and there is no way to get them off without damaging the stitching.Sadly, I didn't notice that until after I'd washed them ... and the date was past the return date limit.I need an undership without labels, as the labels rubbing against my neck drives me nuts!",

I\u2019m 5\u20197 and about 180lbs. The jacket fit perfect. The jacket is warm and water proof. I\u2019m glad I had it on my recent weekend trip where it was cold -and wet.",

        "Fit is spot on. Looks great and it's warm. It is thicker than many of the puffy jackets I have worn. Good for colder weather, down to 25 degrees or colder. Color is a dark navy blue and it is a deal for $60 compared to the jackets I've seen department stores, $100 - $200.",

La chamarra es un poquito larga y mi recomendaci\u00f3n es que pidas una talla menor a la habitual (dependiendo tu complexi\u00f3n). La tela es sumamente suave y es ideal para utilizarla con una sudadera delgada abajo. Si te pones algo muy grueso abajo entonces la chamarra se ve muy justa. Ideal para el fr\u00edo actual en la CDMX. Tiene un corte casual, va bien con jeans o con unos pantalones caqui, tambi\u00e9n se ve muy bien con unos pants.  Sin duda la relaci\u00f3n precio vs calidad es muy buena, incluso te dir\u00eda que est\u00e1 algo barata respecto a la calidad que tiene. No dudes en comprarla, no te vas a arrepentir !!"

        "First time buying this brand and SO happy I did.  These are super comfortable.  The waistband doesn't dig in.  They form well around the boys, yet give you enough room to move.  The price is great.  They seem to be well constructed so I anticipate they will last a good while.",
        "Ive been buying this brand for years. Hubby loves them. Good quality and very soft on the genitals",
        "I bought these after a somewhat frustrating search in which I learned that most men's briefs seem to be missing a fly while being priced astronomically.  I guess that's OK if you are a wealthy guy who pees sitting down, but I'm neither rich nor prone to valuing fashion over practicality.  I was quite impressed by the price of the product at not much more per pair than the typical department store brands, and also liked the fact that the material is 95% cotton versus all the synthetic and bamboo fibers I'd never hear of.  I was also looking for a brief with good support for the family jewels, because I have a chronic inflammation that had been resulting in soreness due to the lack of support provided by the boxer briefs I had been wearing.I received these briefs a few weeks ago and have been wearing them ever since.  They've also been through one wash / dry cycle, so I can report in this review that they held their shape, color and fit - looking and feeling like new out of the dryer.As far as comfort and support, these briefs are amazing!  They're so comfortable that I've started wearing them to bed versus going commando.  At the same time, the briefs hold everything together nicely but without being restrictive.  The above-mentioned soreness I had been experiencing has all but disappeared since just a few days after I started wearing them.All in all, these briefs far exceeded my expectations in every way.  I will buy them again.",
        "The first order of this brand was a pack of black and grey mediums.  After washing and then wearing a pair, the brief was baggy and saggy at the butt on me.  I usually order a medium in another brand. The second order was a pack of black and grey smalls.  After washing and wearing a pair, these fit like a medium size Hanes on me.  Not loose and no sag at the butt.I wore a pair of these on an 8 mile run.  It provided the support for the boys.  It was 50 degrees outside so the underwear did get damp in sweat.  They did not stay damp for long.  I will eventually do a work out in these to see how comfortable they are for that.Overall, I like the soft stretchy material, and the fly.  My one complaint is that the sewing around the crotch is kinda of scratchy.  I hope over time that will not be an issue.1-31-24I worked out in a pair of these Gildan briefs. Fairly comfortable to exercise in.  After the work out, I noticed some sagging at the butt.  The material covering my man parts had shifted towards the backside.  After grabbing the front of the brief and pulling it toward my man parts, the sag had vanished and stayed that way.  There was a slight wedgie action going on during my squat workouts. The Hanes brand does not do this.  I will probably not work out in these going forward.Two days later, I did another leg work out with a different pair of Gildan briefs.  No wedgie action or sag at the butt after my workout.  The only thing I did not do that day is run a few miles before exercising.Also, either the wash and dry cycle did something to the stitching around the crotch or my skin has gotten use to it.  I am happy to say that more packs of these briefs will be purchased.",
        "I hate the large logo on the waist, but that's no reason to deduct any stars.  These fit well, they hug me in all the right ways.  They stay up throughout the day.  I'm really happy with this brand.  This was my first time with these.  I've always been a hanes or fruit of the loom guy... and i decided to try something different.  I\"m glad i did because i really like how these fit and feel.",
        "Comfortable waistband and fits nicely",
        "These are well worth the money for 5 cotton briefs with spandex that hugs your body for all day comfort. Other briefs that are all cotton without the spandex material does not hold its shape which could lead to a wardrobe malfunction, especially when wearing shorts and in the gym. With the Gildan stretch briefs, you are rest assured that wardrobe malfunctions will not happen.",
        "My husband has always wore boxer briefs, but he has been doing some research and wanted to test these out. He loves them! He is very active. He has found that the boxers would ride up and not be comfortable. He has no issue with these! He says they hold everything in place, they are better when hes active, and the softness of the material is great. He is sold on these and will be buying more in the future!",
        "Los adquir\u00ed principalmente porque en las im\u00e1genes se apreciaban con una banda el\u00e1stica gruesa, pero finalmente me conquistaron por la suavidad de la tela y la comodidad del el\u00e1stico en la entrepierna. Ya pedi otros.",
        "These are the most comfortable briefs l have ever worn.  l\u2019m 78 and have always worn briefs, so I\u2019ve gone through a lot of underwear.  Great waistband. The big key for me is the Spandex. That allows them to keep their shape. The 100% cotton briefs that I have worn in the past always just got saggy eventually. Spandex! - don\u2019t go out without it.",
        "Mid to high rise. Support better than Hanes or FOTL. Great elastic band around legs.",
        "A diferencia de otras marcas vienen u poco amplios.",
        "These fit very well and are very comfortable.  I think I perspire just a little more in them than in my old (totally 100% cotton) underwear - but it's by no means excessive and I would buy these again."

        "I have bought thesem jeans in the past. They are perfect for work jeans. Very comfortable and plenty of pockets for your tools, knife, pencils, etc.",
        "I like these pants; they fit great (I prefer a little loose rather than tight/slim pants) and give me the impression that they will last a while.  I've washed them several times now and they still have that same dark blue color, so no fading yet, and they don't seem to have shrunk any.  The only thing I've noticed with them is that the side leg pocket is just a tad smaller (in width) than all the other carpenter pants I wear.  I intentionally buy carpenter pants, and have for many years, because I always keep my iPhone in the side pocket (the deeper one, not the shallow one).  But with these pants, I noticed that I have to work my phone in just right to get it to fit properly.  But, it still fits, and these pants look and feel nice, so I am happy.",
        "Been wearing these carpenter pants ever since the Faded Glory carpenter pants became unavailable about 7 years ago. They've been good cheap work pants that have worked well for me and not been too big of deal when a pair accidentally gets destroyed.  I do have a few issues with them though, specifically with how it seems they keep shrinking the tech pocket down to where many standard phones won't fit anymore.I have visited local wally worlds checking every pair of these pants in my size for probably 6 months, trying to find one that would fit my phone. All of them were way too tight of a fit. I could tell even if I could get the phone around the corner the pocket itself was slightly too narrow.Decided to gamble online and purchased 3 pairs of 40x32 and to my surprise they all fit perfect, doesn't seem to vary from pair to pair. The tech pocket on all 3 was slightly larger than what I had found in the store, but I still had to stretch the opening and pop a couple stitches to comfortably slide my phone in and out of it.  One thing I have noticed when these pockets have been a little tight at first, when you are constantly putting your phone in and out of it, it does loosen up with time, so a snug fit to start is not a bad thing. Just wish I didn't have to pop stitches to get it started.I had already contacted the manufacturer about the tech pocket getting too small to fit common smart phones, they said they'd forward it to the product development engineers for consideration, so hopefully in the future we'll see this pocket open up a little more.  I don't expect it to fit the big \"note\" style phones, but an extra 1/4\" of width would make a world of difference for most people who love these pants specifically for the good design and placement of the cell pocket... or \"tech\" pocket.My other issue I brought up with the manufacturer was the pocket liners. They are terribly thin and it doesn't take long for my keys to start poking holes thru the bottom.  At least I can fix it by folding over the bottom of the pocket and stitching it up, but it would really be nice if the material was a little better like what you get in Carhartts.  These are cheaper than the Carhartts, but not by that much. I definitely prefer the cell phone pocket design in the Wranglers.  Carhartt's cell pockets like 1/2\" wider, but too shallow. The top of my phone pokes out and there's nothing to keep the phone from falling out if I'm working on the ground or even just reclining on a couch.  Glad I found some Wranglers that will work, and 3 identical pairs too!",
        "They fit well and do a great job for pants and are sturdy.",
        "These are accurate in size and love how they feel on .",
        "Really soft fabric and a great fit. I wasn't sure what to expect, because there are so many variations in jeans. But the waist height is perfect; not too high and not to low. There is room in the seat and at the thighs that makes them roomy enough while working.I like the look. They don't have that dark blue new look and they don't look faded. More slightly broken in. A big plus, they came out of the washer and dryer, still soft and they didn't shrink a bit. This is my third purchase, and they all fit and wash the same.",
        "I went from a tight 38\" waist to a loose 34\" and it's hard to get the right fit.  these pants look good and they feel like butter.  nice soft denim.  I'm looking for a boot cut now.",

        "Wow..pretty much all the previous reviews were spot on for these jeans.  They really are that amazing.  They are stretchy, comfy, great color, and the fit for me is perfect!  I am 6'2\" , 225 lbs and got the 35x34.  The length is perfect...not too long and def. not too short.  Some people say they travel in them....I get it....some people hike in them...I can see that too.  They pretty much are just that good.  Now that being said, I do prefer a slim fitting jean...and these are a slimmer fit.  If you have huge thighs or bigger butt...these might not work.  I have thinner legs and they fit just right for my frame.  Don't get confused, they are NOT skinny jeans though...just more of a euro slim cut. Some have mentioned that they are larger around the ankles area?  I didn't really feel that...but after looking closely...maybe just a little.  Of course that can be solved with a small taper.  Overall though...move over jeans...there is a new sheriff in town!",
        "They look great, and they are extremely comfortable.",
        "Bought mainly to use for climbing and they are serving that purpose well.  Waist (mine was 30) sizing was as expected.  Leg fit is definitely slim as described, but the stretchy material and design make it easy to move with no problems.  My legs are towards the skinny side (mid-thigh I'm about 19\" circumference) and it's a great fit for me, although obviously it depends on your leg size.  They are also lighter weight or thinner compared to \"typical\" jeans, which I like for activities.  Actually I like the fit and feel enough that I'll probably also use them some for just regular wear.  Haven't had them long enough to comment on durability, but they look to be well made so I expect no problems.",
        "Looks good, great quality from prana as always.",
        "1 year update: These are now my favorite jeans! Not only have then been great through every season, they've held up incredibly well. I wear these several times a week and no fraying anywhere. I do a lot of bike commuting and these give me the room / stretch that make it really comfortable while biking. My only complaint is that because it is a stretch fabric, certain areas have stretched out. For example, back pocket is not snug so anything I put in there can fall out. But this is not a deal breaker in my book and is a common occurrence with stretch fabrics in general. I love them so much that I've regularly worn them to the office and there's no issue being too casual.Original Review:Got these the day before I took a 5 day road trip and so I took them along. I lived in them every day while traveling. They are super comfortable - felt great while driving, while on hikes, while just hanging around, while eating and shopping, etc. The weather outside was a bit chilly (around 40 degrees) and they kept me warm. I did have a few problems: First, they were a tad long. I ordered 32\" inseams, these fit like 34\". Secondly, the bottom are wide, almost boot cut which I'm not a huge fan. I solved both problems by rolling up the bottom. Third, the fabric is a bit thin for being a jean. We'll see how long they last. Finally, because of these 3 issues, they look definitely more on the casual side and not sure if they will \"pass the grade\" for a more formal jean for going to work. Overall, I love how they feel and will be keeping these to wear in my leisure time.",
        "I'm a robust, strong, muscular, DO-IT-YOURSELF dude from South Africa (now in the USA). I wear prAna shorts, hiking pants, and multiple other prAna gear for all my activities. Whether I'm hiking in the most challenging conditions, working out, or going out with my friends, the prAna fit is incredibly comfortable to accommodate any activity I participate in. I am very physical and active and am never aware of being constrained by my pants, no matter the style (shorts, denim, or casual lux). The fit is always perfect and the materials breathe and even have special, hidden, riveted ventilation where men need it. I'm a huge fan, obviously - yes - buy this. it will become your \"go-to\" brand.",
        "I have several halle, one Halle straight and one Brianna pants.  They are comfortable and quick to dry.  You can dress them up or dress them down.  I wanted to buy Prana for my husband and found these.  I was a little spectacle as some reviews stated the sizes were off.  I was very pleased when my husband tried them on and they fit perfectly.  He loves the color too.  The length was perfect as he is 6 feet.  Waist was perfect.  They have just the right of amount of stretch.  6",
        "I bought these jeans for my husband after his first pair faded from daily wear over a couple of years, and he spilled bleach on his second pair, because I wanted him to have \u201cdress\u201d jeans. They no longer sell a \u201cslim fit\u201d version, so I took a chance on the \u201cstandard fit\u201d. They are still a slim cut, but just slightly looser around the bottom. My husband is 6ft. tall 165 lbs.  with long legs, and surprisingly wears a 32\u201d x 32\u201d, so I would say these jeans run a little large and long. He was so happy with them, I ordered another pair in case they stop making them.",

        "Tr\u00e8s bien, confortable, qualit\u00e9, pour tous les jours",
        "I even wear them in the gym at the  climbing wall, they\u2019re that stretchy/light. Saves a huge amount of weight in my bag if I can work and work out on the same clothes!Only quibble would be that they are quite thin so not sure how long they\u2019ll last. But still great jeans."

THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO IRON!I even had to do some research into the material blend to see if that was the cause but I also but some other brand shirts with the same composition and they are not so difficult to iron. I iron 25 shirts in a single sitting every 6 to 7 weeks. One of these shirts takes me 30 minutes to get to some semblance of acceptability but not really ironed well. The first time I iron 2 and stopped. I said this is ridiculous. The lines would not budge. I gave up and decided that for the first time in my working life, i'll have my shirts ironed by the dry cleaner. I've uploaded some pics of a shirt done by the dry cleaner and you will see, even they had problems because the final product was not a crisp as I am used to.I will be looking for another type of shirt for my next purchase. Hopefully Izod does away with this stretch material failure.Note: I bought 7 different colours/styles of this shirt - they are all the same in difficulty to iron.

I have now ordered three of these shirts with 18 to 18 1/2 neck. I wear ties to work and these shirts are really comfortable.The collars are reasonable size and easily accept a tie under them without much effort. I also like the fact that they are button-down neck and look great with a tie.They are cut to be a loose fit which I appreciate, but they're not drastically baggy. I found the shirts to be well-made and very comfortable.

        "This underwear is super comfortable, is great for the gym and for every day wear. It's moisture wicking so it doesn't absorb sweat, and keeps your body dry. The best part of these is that they don't have any seams running down the butt/back of legs, as most other performance boxer briefs have. This means they don't dig into your skin at all. They ride up a tiny bit in the legs, but stay put for the most part and are pretty flattering.My waist is about 32-33\", I wear 31W pants usually and these fit me well in M. They are pretty snug, but stretch out a lot and are fairly comfortable.Just updating my review to add that I wouldn't recommend these in hot (80F or higher) weather, they are a bit too tight for that and don't have enough mesh to breathe around your legs. I usually don't find them too noticeable, but during warm weather they're slightly uncomfortable. I think UA makes a mesh version that would be much better. In hot weather I prefer Pair of Thieves' superfit mesh underwear, but UA's boxerjocks are still good. I just think I'd go with the mesh version if I were to buy these again. I also wonder if a shorter length would make them more comfortable in warm weather",
        "This is my first pair of boxerjocks I'm trying and I like them very much. Great quality (as expected from under armour), very comfortable, fit as expected. You can easily get spoiled with these and won't buy other underwear. The only problem is that these boxerjocks are expensive and I waited for a deal to buy them.",
        "So as a over six foot, 200 and too many pound guy who is very active outdoors the ol butt coverings in the summer heat are important.  These cradle, don\u2019t bunch and Keep me comfortable all day long.  They dry fast when worn under swim trunks (screw that kid netting stuff) and when sweat happens you dry, nothing is worse than being on a job site and feeling like a baby in a diaper because you were drenched and your boxers are wet.  At first I thought there\u2019s no way I\u2019m spending that.  Well I wore these two pair and the wife was at a local retailer had her pick up more when she was there.",
        "Gave these as gift for teen grandson, who was very pleased with fit and stretch of garment and comfort.",
        "Love the product, super comfortable and actually does help with chafing thanks to the pouch. That said, I wish the product had a close fly version. During work, I sometimes have to bend and shift a lot and it can cause your goods to come out of the fly, very uncomfortable to suddenly have that pressed against the metal zipper of my work pants.",
        "I wear a large in everything, but not this.  I noticed that there were several reviews that said they run large and they do.  I wear a large, but I ordered a medium and they fit nice.  So, I suggest you order one size smaller.  Otherwise they are really nice, especially the waist ban which does not roll over as others always do.  Buy this it's a great price for this product.",

        "I was looking for a light-weight, stylish leather jacket, and I've enjoyed the quality and fit of John Varvatos clothes for some time now; so I was thrilled to find this particular one that wasn't priced into the stratosphere. Like other designer brands, the best John Varvatos jackets are often priced really high. But this one looked like a great deal and I jumped on it. I was very pleased with the look and fit, and the leather has a soft buttery feel to it; very soft. It's also pretty thin overall. It's definitely not a jacket for warmth as much as it is for looks. That being said, the simple addition of a scarf made all the difference in providing adequate warmth to the ensemble. Of course this only matters in winter months. But the quality is really nice, and the size worked out great. I ordered a medium as I typically wear between 38-40 jacket size. It fits like it was tailored for me personally.",

        "the pants fit well, are comfortable, and very nicely priced. i'm extremely pleased with them and have bought several pairs",
        "Good, comfortable, warm sweats from this Amazon brand. I have several pairs which I wear as part of my \"office\" attire (work from home). They've held up well to many wash-wear cycles, with extended wear time.They're very good during cold weather, but light enough for spring/fall. I'd consider them too heavy for working out (or for \"summer\"), but fine for yard tasks or chores.The heathered version feels a little different from the solid fabric. I also noticed some variation in size, with one L being slightly too short in the rise, and one XL being a bit baggier than I expected. Not sure if that's just my copies, or how pre-shrunk the fabric was. American clothing manufacturers seem to change production a lot, and that can mean things fit differently from batch to batch, year to year, etc.The oldest solid-colored have faded / pilled a little, the oldest heathered doesn't show any noteworthy deterioration although I've worn it dozens of days and goodly number of washes.This style (closed bottom) is my preference for around the house (shoeless), to avoid dragging the fabric on the ground. Unless you're exactly the expected height, open-bottom pants will typically drag and get frayed/discolored/dirty/damp.Be sure to check through colors, sometimes one color is surprisingly cheaper. At these low prices, it's hard to complain about the variation in sizing, and they remain part of my regular attire.",
        "Nice & soft on inside. Definitely keeps my lower half warm. Fits nice and comfortable to drive in. Appears to be made well, will know better once I wash it.",
        "First of all, the fit is so snug it's like a comforting embrace from your long-lost teddy bear. These pants make you feel like you can do ninja moves and Olympic gymnastics all at once...or maybe just reach for that bag of chips on the top shelf without pulling a muscle, but hey, close enough!The camo design is a riot. Forget blending in with nature, these pants make you stand out like a fashion superhero. Picture disco balls attending a jungle party, and that's the level of attention you'll receive. People will be doing double takes, wondering if you're an undercover fashion genius or just lost your way to a military base. The confusion is half the fun!And durability? These pants took on thorny bushes and even an accidental paintball shootout. They're tougher than a drill sergeant with a grudge. They survived it all, and even Bigfoot tried to snatch 'em, but these pants were like Bigfoot repellent. Unbelievable!In conclusion, these Amazon camo sweatpants are a hilarious fashion must-have. They'll make you feel like a comedy superstar and turn heads faster than a dog spotting a squirrel. So grab a pair, embrace the ludicrousness, and get ready to laugh harder than you have in years. Just a warning, though, make sure to keep your cat away from your acrobatic moves!",
        "I first bought these for my husband during a huge sale. I only only paid $8.00 so I bought him several pair. I figured if he didn\u2019t like them I would donate them.We were both shocked ! These are the best sweats he\u2019s ever worn ;)Not only are they nice and thick but they are extremely well made. Soft fabric and extremely comfortable. I liked them so much that I bought myself a few pair in the woman\u2019s dept.Absolutely love them !He looks so good in them. They aren\u2019t bulky. He\u2019s 5\u20199\u201d 165 and wears a medium. I have purchased these for 3 years now. Not because they wear out but because it\u2019s always nice to get new colors. He wears these around the house and being retired , that\u2019s most of the time. ( good thing we like one another , hahaha )You don\u2019t have to pay full price for these . They always go on sale. Just check weekly. They will mark a few pair down without announcing it. I usually pay $14.Really , just buy these. The cool part is you can always find a matching sweatshirt. My husband isn\u2019t in to sweatshirts as he runs hot but I buy the front zipper ones. That makes a nice set ! He especially loves the toffee color. \ud83d\ude1d",
        "i've bought these amazon basic sweats for years. this time, i ordered some, i take a couple out of the box to make sure nothing has changed, and i thought i had gotten childrens clothes! i took one pair from this order and laid it overtop  a new pair from 2020 and this years version is physically smaller than the same size that was made even a couple years ago. so, my advice is to now order 1 size larger than you think you need.  the quality/softness is still there, so if you do that, you should be fine. i've returned this order and reordered in 1 size larger.edit: received new order - 1 i size larger is better in the hip area; but where the crotch is sewn is higher than the same amazon basic sweat i ordered several years earlier. so, they're wearable but not near as comfy as the ones i purchased a few years ago. i won't be buying any more.",
        "Perfect fit. Excellent quality and thick.",
        "I really like the warmth and fit of these sweatpants, and will probably buy another pair.  I do wish they had more elastic in the waste, as it's kind of a pain to have to tie the drawstring to keep them tight.",
        "These trousers are warm and comfortable, and the price is affordable.",
        "Muy c\u00f3modos.",
        "Es mas grande.pero tiene una buena calidad",
        "These fit my boyfriend perfectly and he is practically living in them since Christmas.  They wash and wear easy and the quality is great. He says they are the most comfortable sweatpants he's ever had. He usually wears under armor sweatpants and they end up with holes in them and they cost about 60 a pair so these are incredibly affordable in comparison and the quality is better. I have a couple more pairs in my Amazon cart for the next time I do a shop so he has more to wear on rotation. I ordered him a large, he is a 32/32 around 5'11\" tall. There is room but not too baggy. Order a size up if your man isn't on the lean side. I ordered the Amazon essential crew neck sweatshirts to match in a size xl cause the sweatshirts fit smaller and they make a perfect pair. Looks put together even if he's lounging around.",

The large works but I need to pull the drawstring. It says slim fit but doesn't feel that way.

Ordered small - really wanted XS, but 2XU does not make much for XS guys.  Still, this works - good compression in abs, moderate compression above waist.  I was worried about the white color becoming transparent after sweat through, but it is thick enough material to prevent that issue.  Overall very good product and the sale price was great.  Docked 1 star for the limited chest compression.",

        "I've had 3 Dubliner Jackets over the years. The inner lining always wears out,  it starts a year in and by 3 years of you wear anything you have white flakes everywhere! Hopefully the insulated jacket will solve this problem, by sealing it all inside. It fits just a little bit tighter than the jacket without the insulation. I hope it lasts for years to come. They have always been comfortable jackets in the past. Typically the jackets (Dubliner by H/H) closures have been velcro, but on this jacket there are snaps on both the cuffs and down the middle. I haven't decided if this is a positive or negative yet. The appearance of the jacket is nice and perfect for everyday wear for both casual and business. The hood tucks away nicely, but gives a really puffy neck, due to the insulation.",
        "I really like this jacket, I would agree with most reviews that this coat runs a little small. I am a L usually and fit well in a Extra L. I am in Anchorage Alaska the weather has been 10 - 20F and I have been wearing a light insulated layer. I have their thicker coat coming now, I might need the heavier coat, I would say that this coat is perfect for spring skiing, probably a little light for dead of winter 10F and below.",
        "It was everything I had hoped for, except it was too small even though I used the Helly Hanson sizing guide and asked for a loose fit. When I say too small, I mean snug in every area. Big disappointment because the XL was $50 more. What the heck!Update, the XL went on sale and I bought it. It fits really great and I really like the features. Soon after I got it we went skiing. Though it never got below 0F it was fairly cold and windy on the lifts. I'd say this jacket will keep you warm down into the teens without any problem. It is very windproof and everything but the soft collar is waterproof.",
        "Need to order much larger size than I normally wear",
        "I was a little concerned about this with the fit, I ordered both the L and XL to make sure I would get it in time to go skiing. I wore this over top of a thermal base layer and a Carhartt puffer jacket in -20 degree (F) weather and I wasn't cold skiing. For sizing reference, I am 6' 2\" and I weigh 170 lbs, the L ended up being the perfect fit for me, even with the extra layers I mentioned.",
        "I boat this as a spring boating jacket but ended up using it as a light winter jacket.  The quality is way better than I expected. Feels like a much more expensive jacket.",
        "My go-to on a regular basis.  Not sure how I got along before without it.Great jacket for cool weather down to about 45 degrees without layering (assuming no wind).  Fully waterproof.  Wear it all the time for wet Spring/Fall days.  Put on a layer for colder days down to freezing weather or wind.  Beyond that, you're into snow and will wear heavier jacket anyways...Love it!",
        "The jacket itself is fine and nice, just what I expected. But they put in a crappy cheap zipper. It's the type of flimsy plastic zipper you expect to find on much cheaper clothes. It's fussy and hard to fasten at the bottom. I would normally expect a jacket at this price to have a better zipper. Not what I expect for a $200 jacket.",
        "Water proof, quality and style. Great",
        "Musste lange suchen und auch einige Jacken wieder zur\u00fcckschicken bis ich gefunden habe, was meinen Vorstellungen entsprach.Die Jacke sollte auch bei Regen etwas mehr als nur \"abweisend\" sein, sollte etwas warm geben und nicht gleich an einem kleben bleiben sowie nicht aussehen wie ein \u00fcbergezogener Sack.Die Jacke tr\u00e4gt sich wunderbar, der Schnitt ist super - die \u00c4rmel nicht zu lang, der Bund nicht zu weit, innen das leichte Futter isoliert leicht - einfach top.Trage die derzeit auch bei Temperaturen um die 0\u00b0 mit einem Pulli oder einem Flie\u00df darunter - das reicht und wenn es regnet, wie hier bei uns im Winter aktuell so \u00fcblich, bleibt man trocken. Die dicke Daunenjacke w\u00e4re hier fehl am Mann.Hatte vor Jahren etwas \u00c4hnliches von der Marke mit der gelben Tatze, mit der war ich von der Passform sehr unzufrieden und vor allem war man darin sehr schnell nass - bzw. durch das Kondenswasser war die innen benetzt, ein teurer Schrott!Die HH ist preislich f\u00fcr mich ein absoluter Treffer, sieht optisch sehr gut aus und tr\u00e4gt sich top.Ein Manko w\u00e4re vielleicht die geringe Anzahl Taschen auf der Au\u00dfenseite, aber die bringen auch Nachteile - daher f\u00fcr mich vertretbar.",

        "Really love the design, the fit, and the overall comfort.  The wicking material really does work, and I am only buying more now because the ones I had for a year, well, a few of them, are finally ready to be thrown away after about a year of regular use.",
        "I was looking for a supportive pair of underwear, that also wasn't too constricting while worn.  These bikinis offer that, and so much more.  They are lightweight, yet offer support.  They are shear, but still allow modesty if desired.  They breathe well, and also help keep you cool on hotter days.  At first, they don't feel like they'll stretch enough for comfort, but after wearing them for a bit, they kind of even out all around.  The material feels wonderful, and they seem to hold up quite well while being washed.  After trying these bikinis out on a whim, I will definitely be getting more for my wardrobe.",
        "They've become my favorite pair of work underwear. Tight enough they absorb all the sweat and keep it that way, even standing. More supportive than most underwear. Loses a star for being advertised as seamless, especially where the seams can actually be just a bit irritating to the skin because of where it sitsIt's been a month or so, and I've come into a new serious complaint. I love these underwear so much, but the regular waistband compared to Hanes standard elastic microfiber band are absolutely terrible, slide down on your hips and can be uncomfortable if you just want them to stay where they are. My real complaint is that Hanes doesn't have an option I can choose from",
        "I have bought three packs of these now so figured I should leave a review. These are very, very basic briefs but they fit well and the narrow waistband makes them incredibly comfortable, almost like wearing nothing at all.They do eventually fall apart but then, they are also constantly being worn and washed, so I suppose that is to be expected. At any rate, the price point for the pack is good, so it\u2019s not a hard decision when it\u2019s time to re-up.",
        "I have bought like items from other companies and they have been too small (all around, not just in one area), but thee fit very well and are very comfortable.",
        "I wore a pair for a day, ran them through a wash and dry cycle with the rest of my laundry, and wore them for another day. I found them to be very comfortable both times. I especially like there are no seams except for the waist and leg bands. I have a bit of a belly so the low waist is great in keeping them from sliding down. The multiple colors is kinda fun too. The best part is they are wife approved.",
        "It\u2019s difficult to buy good quality underwear these days. Trusted brands are made in foreign countries and sizing is confusing and quality is lacking.I bought these Hanes Men's Tagless Comfort Flex Fit Dyed Bikini (6 Pack) thinking they would be fine but they\u2019re not up to the Hanes brand I\u2019ve used for decades.I don\u2019t think I will buy any more Hanes products after this.I like that the material is part cotton and modal and spandex because I didn\u2019t want much shrinkage after washing but these briefs are just lacking in many ways.The elastic is just laying there and not doing much. It also flips on my hips so I have to adjust the elastic because it goes inside out on its own.The width of the fabric in the crotch area seems narrow to me and there is no contouring in the pouch.The fabric just lays flat so it\u2019s not supporting your \u201cjunk.\u201d It\u2019s just a super thin cover.In a way, it\u2019s like you\u2019re not wearing underwear but you do want to feel covered, protected and supported.I would not feel comfortable wearing these underwear without something falling out in the leg opening. I want to sleep in comfortable, contained underwear. These don\u2019t do the job.Sorry but that\u2019s my take on these Hanes underwear.",
        "I bought three in November and liked it so much that I bought another six at the end of January.",
        "Son muy c\u00f3modos, la tela no es gruesa pero es resistente y me gusta que transpiran.",
        "After reading an number of reviews I had some concern buying these as there were many negative comments. However, I decided to try it anyway as the manufacturer is a good one.I got the items as promised and I am very happy with them.They fit exactly as should.I am 6'  160lb 32\" waist.I ordered the medium and it is a perfect fit.Very happy with them.Maybe I did not read the full ad (very possible) but I thought I was getting 6 black ones but got a mixed color package. Not a big deal as it is underwear - which almost no one sees anyway.Now there are 2 possible issues though for some guys.1) very thin - basically a non absorbent material - so anyone that \"dribbles\" at all, it would probably not work for you. Very little to none absorption.  I don't have any issues though.2) Although they are very comfortable, they offer very little support for the \" Wiggly bits\" for those that need extra support. Again - it works great for me.I found this to be a great buy and would order them again.I didn't find any of the negative comments mentioned by other buyers.Give them a try..... you should be very happy with them",
        "Recently tried the Hanes brand of underwear and have to say I\u2019ve been very impressed with the quality of the productsThese briefs fit me perfectly (size L, I\u2019m a 33\u201d waist), and just feel so soft and smooth to the extent you forget you\u2019re even wearing them.I also find these are absolutely perfect to wear when doing any running, they don\u2019t ride up and become uncomfortable, would recommend 100%",

        "These are quality made canvas shorts. They look nice.  However, when I wore them, I quickly found that the length is about 2 inches too long. The worst part is the pockets.  The velcro is very stiff and I found it difficult to access my wallet in the back pocket.  The worst part is that the front pockets go all the way down to the hem. I put my keys in one and my phone in the other.  When I walked, both were banging against the top of my knee cap.  It was so uncomfortable that I emptied the pockets so I could finish my day.  I will use them to work outside but not in daily use.",

I tried this pair of Wrangler cargo shorts and to me, they fit great, feel great, the velcro on the pockets works great, everything is double stitched, the price is better than EBs, even if they're on clearance. This is my new favorite cargo shorts. I bought one to try it, then a 2nd pair in another color a week later.",

It's heavy duty and difficult to separate making it nearly impossible to get into the back pockets to put in or take out his wallet and phone. I'm going to have to remove it, hoping the shorts don't rip. I would recommend these, only if you're willing to deal with the velcro.",

La tela es resistente, tiene varios bolsillos de buen tama\u00f1o con cierre velcro pero no se hacen estorbosos ni sobre salen mucho del short, lo cual ayuda a darle un aspecto casual.

        "There's not a lot to dislike about these very practical cargo shorts, if you don't mind they're not the most exciting color.  It's hard to tell if the color is blue or green, it's so light and generic looking.They have 6 well thought out pockets, which is why you buy these in the first place.  There's also a small extra pocket.  The material isn't the heaviest, but it's in no way threadbare.  Sizing was a perfect fit for me at a 32 waist without need for a belt.  No trick elastic waistband to go bad.Something I really like is they are actually shorts.  Many of the cargo shorts you will find are almost as long as beach pants.  These ones have a 7 inch inseam.There are flashier, more expensive shorts on Amazon made with different materials that are similar to these in basic function.  These ones have everything you would need for practical cargo shorts.I JUST noticed they've added 2 new colors that weren't available when I purchsed.  Anthracite (dark grey), and Nutmeg  (tasteful subdued yellow).  These appear to be all larger sizes, at least at the moment.I forgot to mention these shorts are 100% cotton - which will be important to some people.",

        "I purchased this because my old sleeveless shirts are getting very worn. One reason I like my current ones is that they have broader shoulder straps and a close neck, which allows the shirt to sit more securely on your frame. This one is a bit \"strappy\", and has a bit of a lower neckline, which to me feels less secure.However, that is mostly a matter of taste. This is very lightweight, and supremely breathable. If you need to move in it and you want airflow, this is for you. Almost no restriction whatsoever on arm movement. As a tank top, it excels in this respect.In terms of fit: I purchased a Medium in black. I'm about 5'10\", my chest is about 41\", my waist is about 32\". This is called fitted, but it is still quite loose, nothing remotely like a compression shirt. I would say it is true to size.Visually, it accentuates the delts, neck, traps, clavicle, etc, much more than even a compression t-shirt or a sleeveless shirt with broader straps, sort of freaked me the first time I looked at myself in the mirror. Other than that, this is not too tight, so it isn't going to show off much definition except at the shoulders.All in all; I don't know if it  for me, like I said it's a bit strappy and thus a bit showy However, if you want a very effective tank for running, lifting, sports, and manual labor, this is a solid choice.",

They wash up great but it is best to air dry for longevity of shirt. Been wearing these silk shirts for snowmobiling for over 20 years. I was happy to find this shirt as they are getting harder to find. I will be purchasing another one.",
        "I am happy with my purchase.  I like the fit (I am 6'5), I like the effectiveness of the base layer, I like the light weight silky fabric and I like the length that accommodates tall people.  I hand washed and open air dried my thermasilk pants/base layer.  However, the pants developed runs and holes.  Therefore, they must be replaced each year.  I highly recommend this product and will buy it or something like it for next Fall/Winter.",
        "This is silk - real silk, but it is thin. A recent test by the US government ranked fibers by warmth as animal fibers (such as fur or wool) as best, cotton next, Spandex as third, silk as fourth, and synthetics as fifth. By itself, silk is not warm. Thick silk base layers, such as Lands End silk base layer for men, are warm-ish. At best silk base layers make other clothing move without making cold gaps next to your skin. This is good enough. However, Thermasilk is best if you put something warm and close to your body over it. Then it really shines as a base. Your movement will be unrestricted and your core body will be warm. It also packs up into a really small bundle if you have to backpack it. Thermasilk is light weight, easily packed, and helpful when building layers. It also doesn't pick up odors, so it doesn't stink. Finally, you must never discount the fact that it feels like silk. On top of all that, Thermasilk offers a reasonably decent price.",
        "Tore after one day of gentle use?I've owned silks before, even owned this brand before.  I'm careful how I treat them.These had a run on the second day!",
        "On durability: If you have never tried silk underwear before you need to be warned.  Durability is not a strong feature.  Even the best made silk undergarments compromise durability for high performance.  If you agree to this compromise you get the very best garment for a variety of situations, but you will only get something that lasts for one to 3 seasons of moderate use before holes and tears develop.  If you are on a budget and you are not dealing with demanding cold weather situations, and big swings in temperature, you might not want to spend the money for silk, but even people who don't spend a lot of time in extreme weather will quickly notice the difference in comfort, and performance that silk provides over any other material.  Also keep in mind that silk is very thin.  Silk is only intended to be a base layer.  A proper fit for the bottoms should have the material right next to the skin with no baggy areas. In sub zero temperatures many silk users will elect to also wear a second set of long underwear over silk so as to provide for more warmth.  Wool, a man made material, or even another layer of silk can work well for that.I live in northern Minnesota right up next to canada, I've tried most if not all of the other materials and I'll always buy silk as long as I can afford it, it does what nothing else does.  I would rather wear worn out old silk with a few small holes than a lot of that other stuff.Insofar as this brand goes, I will say that I was instantly impressed.  Everything looks to be high quality.  The fit beats the other silk underwear that I've tried from LLBean, Cabelas, or WinterSilks.  Someone finally figured out how to design the male trap door in a secure way so that Don Rickles doesn't make a surprise guest appearance on the Tonight show. I haven't had a chance to do anything else but try it on, but I expect these to work as well or better than everything else I've tried in silk.  Wear them, tear them, replace.Don't be a dope and throw your silks in the washing machine with your jeans! Before you do that just save yourself the trouble and the price of shipping and throw your money into the nearest trash can.  To wash correctly; wash only small loads with silks separate from other garments, wash on gentle cycle or hand wash, then hang to dry.  No drying machines.",
        "Excellent warmth.",
        "Just straight scam. No silk involved. Looked old.",

        "I bought these for my husband and he is 6 foot 250 lbs and they fit perfect. Long enough and not too big or small. Something I have learned with all men's cotton T-shirts though...take them out of the dryer while they are still damp and hang them up. This prevents fading and shrinkage. Seems silly for T-shirts but I don't like having to buy them all the time.",
        "These have been my favorite, go to t-shirts in the last 15 years. While other manufacturers like Calvin Klein and American essentials have skimped on quality, 2xist has kept up with outstanding clothing. One of the biggest pluses is this is a seamless t-shirt! Not sure why others don't do this, must be that they are cheaper to produce in two pieces then one. Highly recommended",
        "I normally wear an XL t-shirt.I bought large to be a snug undershirt.These are very baggy like an outer t-shirt on me.I haven't worn a medium since like 6th grade but I might consider going that small on my next order.The shirts are pretty good and fit well.  Good wicking ability too.",
        "I wear a t-shirt everyday and used to buy Stafford but quality went downhill along with the length (seems this is where they cut costs) which means the come untucked.  Ordered at least 5 different brands and stumbled on this one and they are BY FAR the best.  They are soft and the collars hold up wash after wash.  Highly recommend.",
        "I bought a 3-pack of the 2(x)ist V-necks about 10 years ago and have loved the shirts. They've been worn to almost every occasion but after all that time, they've been needing replacements. Enter these. The quality of these is a bit thicker than my original shirts. Then again, those original shirts have been washed over and over in the course of a decade, so it's expected. Shirts are pretty much true-to-fit. They're about 2\" longer than my previous shirts, but are pretty much every bit the same quality. I'm actually ordering another 3-pack.",
        "I searched for Jockey, found this and orderedThe inside of the shirt back near top has printed jockey made in china.I have 4 very excellent Jockey tees previously ordered and they all are made in India.These are much thinner cotton and much lower quality.",

        "I got one in \u2018TV static\u2019 grey, 2 academy blue, one Royal and one black. The grey and blue fit perfect and have a longer tail. The black barely covers my waist band. Like a halter top if I reach up for anything. The two academy blue fit differently like one is slightly bigger. The shirts are nice though, they dry fast and keep the sun off my shoulders. I\u2019m happy with the prices I got too.",
        "I buy these on sale and have been lucky so far.  They are far more durable and fit better than \"always cheap\" synthetic tees.  The stitching survives a lot of use - no loose or hanging threads so far.  They are not super breathable and not super heavy.  I wear large size in summer for air flow but medium most of the year.  They dry fast and I can easily just hang them up overnight to dry vs a dryer (this makes shirts last a LOT longer if you do that).I have a hard time paying full price for anything. They would probably be worth it at full price but sales happen and these are good, durable tees.  Get one or try one to see how it fits on you.",
        "I\u2019m 6\u20191\u201d , 190 lbs with a slim build. I don\u2019t like how most shirts fit. Large is usually to short and I swim in xtra large. These shirts ( large tall) are perfect! They land just below zipper but don\u2019t look like a dress like some do. The material is extremely comfortable, silky but not flimsy. Any stains usually come right out with a paper towel and water, and they do not wrinkle. One bit of advice is to hanger dry though as they will shrink a little in the dryer. I\u2019ve ordered 5 of these now and the cut is consistent on all of them. Pretty much the same quality as you will pay a lot more for in any store that sells them. Shipping is fast too.",
        "I like this shirt. It\u2019s a warm weather T-shirt, very lightweight and comfortable. I\u2019m 6\u2019 170 lbs, and I ordered a medium. It seems a bit tight in the armpit area, but fits great everywhere else. If you\u2019re between a medium and large, I\u2019d go with the large. This shirt is so lightweight that I was afraid to run it through a full dry cycle, so I dried it on low for a few minutes and then hung it up to air dry. That works great; it was almost dry anyway after just 5 minutes on low. Nice shirt; kind of reminds me of Nike\u2019s Dri-Fit material, very soft and stretchy. I\u2019m happy with it; I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy another one.",
        "Under Armour keeps putting out some fantastic clothes, and these shirts work great for me in all aspects. As a true fanboy, I own at least 6 of exact same ones. These shirts take YEARS to show wear, even after daily workout sessions and around the house/yard/garage chores - it's a perfect do-it-all shirt. I love how soft and thin these are, they're breathable, excellent for working out as the wick sweat and allow your body to stay cool during the workout. I've worn the hell out of them and they still look great, I think maybe one from like 8 years ago is finally showing it's age, but hey - it's 8 solid years of use!",
        "Unlike another major sports apparel brand with shirts that look like a fabric rectangle hanging from my shoulders, these shirts compliment my upper body. I bought several, including a couple as Christmas presents. I am pleased with my shirts, and my family members were really excited about theirs.",

        "The loose fit is prefect. I wear these to work and out to casual occasions. I have a 34 waist but I size up to 36 because they tend to run small. They are super comfortable and durable. I wash mine with fabric softeners and after about two months they become exactly the fit I like. I\u2019m in my mid 40s and have been wearing Dickies most of my life and they never go out of style.",
        "So I measured my waist and my hips with a tape measure. Waist: 44 Hips: 42. I normally wear Levi's (36x30) at my hips, so I ordered size 42. They arrived in size 42, which was correct. But when I put them on at the hips, they are way too large, like, I can fit a softball between my body and the shorts' waistband. When I pull them up to my waist, they are just a bit loose. SO, my figuring is that they are sized a bit more than 2 inches larger than reality. I'll send them back and get a size 40 to see what happens. I'll review those as well so you can see my results. I'll also not be ordering relaxed fit 11\" inseam instead of loose fit 13\" inseam. These loose fit 13\" inseam feel/look like I'm wearing my mother's culottes, as they end 3 or 4 inches below my knees! Nothing wrong with that--just not my tempo...EDIT: I actually tried different sizes on at a big box store; I found that 38 waist relaxed fit 13\" inseam fits best. Just a little bit of extra wiggle room. Again, I measure 42\" at my hips, and the size 38 sits on my hips just right.Otherwise, Dickies make fantastic affordable shorts and pants! Tough as nails, and comfortable (once you figure out your size). I'm fairly rough with them; skateboarding serves as my quality test, and Dickies last forever. I'm having to figure out my size because I'm buying my first new ones ever; I've always just bought them at thrift stores before, so I never really knew what I was getting, just looking for the Dickies tag and trying different ones on until I found the ones that fit.",
        "Quality is excellent and volor is as ordered but they are longer pant leg than anticipated.",
        "Shorts of good quality just like regular Dickies from the store. Only difference is you can tell that these have never been unfolded. They have so much Scotchgard that they can literally stand in the corner lol. The reviews are correct which suggest getting a size a bigger because these for some reason seem to run small. I got a size bigger than what I normally wear and they fit perfectly.",
        "My fianc\u00e9 wears these to work in the summer. The material is on the heavy side but that is ok as he works with chemicals that can eat through fabric. No holes, rips or tears. We have purchased these in the past and they will hold up for years.",
        "The quality on these are amazing and these are honestly my favorite pair of shorts i have! They\u2019re so much cheaper on here compared to buying them from the mall or other online retailers and they fit amazingly true to size!",
        "im not sure if I have bigger legs then your average joe but I cant squat comfortably with these while on the job, even worse during rush hour. its usable I just have to adjust my shorts by pulling them up slightly by my hip area and giving space for my legs to not rip apart the short when squatting. I rather the stretchy kind of shorts since it doesnt rip literally at all. very stylish and is perfect for anything besides work use.",
        "These are cool shorts, comfortable, Big, Baggy, but the only problem is the belt loops, absolutely HORRIBLE! Impossible to get my belt to go through twice to put the extra through. So tight, why would anyone design belt loops like this? Fix this problem and we\u2019re good. You will need a belt with these, unless you order two sizes down. They run EXTREMELY LONG AND LARGE. But very comfortable and if you have dogs or cats, might want to stay away from the black pair. It\u2019s a fur magnet, and order plenty of lint rollers along with these shorts, you will definitely need them. Also one more thing, the button, change that to a normal button please, damn thing keeps coming undone. It\u2019s the little things that really hurt these shorts. Pockets are decent. Cell phone pocket on thigh is cool.",
        "Ya me estoy comprando m\u00e1s colores",
        "Buen producto, solo considerar 2 tallas m\u00e1s grande de la que uses.",
        "Order was received quick.  Now comes the but.  I own several pairs of these shorts.  Soo comfy and right length for me.  Now this is the first time I ordered them from Amazon.  Ordered 32 waist as all my other pairs are 32.  I can\u2019t even come close to buttoning them up.  I checked tag and it says 32.  Should return but I live too far away from a purolator drop spot.  Cost me more in gas than it would for the shorts.  Will be donating to a charity and hope some one can make use of them.  Very disappointed as I live in these exact shorts for work and play all spring through fall.",
        "They fit me still ok but definitely thought that with the size I got was up a size or 2 but I was wrong. I should have gone up 2 sizes they fit snug around the waist.",
        "I'm a big guy and these shorts are awesome. I love my dickies there the only shorts I buy."

        "Does everything a heavy winter jacket should do, and it's actually lightweight and compressible. For all of that, 5 stars. I ding'd a star because Columbia lies about it having an inner pocket. It does NOT have an inner security pocket. The Columbia website states that it does as well, but clearly Columbia never squared this with their off-shore manufacturing factory. That aspect was a big disappointment to me, but the jacket was perfect enough in all other ways to be a keeper nonetheless.",

        "So first off, it\u2019s a great overall hoodie. Especially at the cyber deals going on now. I got my black one for $20! Ok. so I bought the grey one first. The left arm does not line up seams from the arm to the cuff. It wouldn\u2019t be noticeable if it didn\u2019t turn the \u201cC\u201d logo on the arm and make it face towards my torso. Other than that I love it. Soft and very form fitting. I do wish the cuff at the bottom was tighter but that\u2019s champions thing. Longer in the front than the back slightly and the back not \u201cgripping\u201d you. That being said, I\u2019m incredibly ocd/adhd. It\u2019s not a big deal at all.the black one I just got seems flawless\u2026. So far. One other thing to add to the grey..I noticed it is piling up on the kangaroo pocket and other places that get a lot of attention. I have an electric pill cutter so nbd unless it continues. I didn\u2019t notice it till after the first wash and literally just after placing the order for the black. These are identical to the much thicker black one I have.Bottom line: It\u2019s a good buy at the discounted cyber/Black Fridayprices. Idk that I would pay regular price for them. Actually I do know. I wouldn\u2019t. Not thick enough for reg price. I use them to go with my joggers I workout in. They look great with joggers. Idk if they\u2019re long enough to wear with jeans. My thick black one isn\u2019t either.Hope this helps!Update: I now have 3 more colors and here\u2019s what I found out. The black one is cheaper for a reason. The cuffs are not off good elasticity at all. All three of the others have tight cuffs on arms and waist. I have dark grey, oatmeal grey (favorite) and Heather grey. Ask there are perfect. Fit exactly the same. The cuff thing is important to me bc I don\u2019t like my iwatch ultra being covered up all day. Having to move the arm to mess with the watch is an annoyance. So I sent the black one back for good. There\u2019s reason it was $6 cheaper than the rest people!The dark grey in my pics. The other two fit exactly the same.**Notice how the cuff sits and doesn\u2019t go over my watch",

        "I purchased this suit for a wedding my best friend was having in Cancun, and true to her nature she had it on the beach. The invitation said \"Beach Formal\", an attire description I'm still not completely clear what it means. This suit definitely fit the bill! It was light enough to breath under the hot Mexican sun, yet substantial enough to give the dressy feel I was looking for. The suit fit exactly as expected, and the material was high quality linen with a tight weave and a soft feel to it. If I had the time I would have removed the silk lining, however its a nice touch if you are not planning on wearing it on a beach during the summer. This suit was a perfect fit for the look I was hoping to be wearing for the wedding, and I am very satisfied with my purchase.",
        "Great suit jacket! The sleeves were a bit long though, we had to pay to have them altered. Which significantly increased the price. But it fit well through the body and looks nice on. I recommend the matching vest!",
        "Very nice jacket.... It's Linen.... expect some wrinkles - will steam out pretty well....  perfect weight for Spring & Summer wear.  Light color.... goes with most everything... including jeans & kakis.  Can dress up or down.... Very happy with the purchase.  Me -> 42 R (true)... jacket fits well (fitted) making a little snug in the ribs.... I don't have a 'beer'belly' or a 6 pk... can pinch a little more than an inch though.  A generous belly will have a problem with the buttons.",
        "I ordered this at the last minute- 3 days before a destination wedding- and I was not only extremely relieved when it arrived within two-days, but I also couldn't believe how well it fit.My gf Youtube'd how to properly take suit measurements and it fit exact to my measurements.Also, the quality of the linen was impressive.",
        "At first I got the wrong size that had that tight fit young people like today; but it is not my style. So I easily returned it and asked for the next larger size (42). It fits perfectly and looks like a million bucks. I have an Armani suit for which I paid $800 at Sak's Fifth Avenue. This Perry Ellis linen jacket looks just as good.",
        "A bit large at the trunk but pretty good at the chest. The arm length is also a bit long as is the length of the jacket. I\u2019m 6\u20195\u201d so it\u2019s not often that something is big on me. Still a very nice jacket.",
        "This is a nice light yet lined jacket and I really liked it when it arrived, but quickly the seams started to fail.  So while it is good for a few evenings, one trans-pacific flight and its starts to fail.So OK for a light dinner jacket, but not sturdy enough for travel.",

        "As a big guy (6'-5\", 275 lbs) its a challenge to find a 3XL size that really fits.  I like this jacket because the size is adequate; not too huge, not too tight. The material is soft, stretches, and high quality. The look is modern, slimming, and classy.  I do wish there's a pocket for my mobile phone...but it seems the bulky size would distract from the clean look (when I fly...I like my phone to be accessbile)",
        "I am usually not a fan of workout looking or atheletic looking jackets, nor anything made of synthetic materials such as all polyester or nylon.  However, this jacket was a big suprise upon arrival as it is incredible soft to the touch on the exterior, complemented by equally fine layer of fleece on the inside.  As others have pointed out, it may look light and thin - but does have a bit of a punch against the cold that works really well.",
        "Okay, so I\u2019m feeling a bit of buyer\u2019s remorse about this purchase. Never heard of the Cutter and Buck brand before and I never paid almost $100 for a jacket, if you want to even call it that\u2026feels and wears more like a zip-up sweater, which to me doesn\u2019t justify the high price tag. I based my purchase decision on the few reviews posted and on the product images. The product pictures had me thinking that the outside shell would be of a more durable, tougher material, like an actual jacket, not a sweater. Also thought that the fleece liner on the inside would be a tad thicker; it\u2019s actually paper thin. Furthermore, I was thinking the coat would have a perfect, flawless construction, but I had to snip off with a scissors a bit of loose, sloppy stitching, which was disappointing, especially at this price. On the positive side, it fits great and is very comfortable. However, I\u2019d return this jacket in a heartbeat and look for something else (for much less money) had I not removed the tags.

        "Finally, a perfect shirt for hot, sticky Florida!  I have bought Columbia shirts before, but all the pockets rod holders and the like limited my use of the shirts. They just didn't make a casual shirt for about town.  These however, have a neat somewhat polished look. The material is fantastic and I don't break into a sweat the minute I walk out the door.They seem highly wrinkle resistant and the single chest pocket, is tastefully done and makes me want to wear my good jewelry with it.  After trying on my first one, I immediately ordered 5 more. The color palate is awesome.  These babies will never see a fish unless it's on a dinner plate.",

        "Comfortable and fits well. Only complaint is that it might hang an inch or so too low. This is especially noticable if you need to go a size up because you carry a little extra weight.",
        "I love the Slack Tide columbia men's shirt - its made of that ultra-lightweight polyester material w/fairly subtle vents built into the back along w/a mesh panel liner across the upper back and shoulder area.  This mesh keeps the material off the skin so the breathability is even better than you'd expect. The chest pocket is located in the right spot for the smaller-size wearer; I cant stand when a shirt that fits my shoulders and upper body shape well but has the pocket located too low.  This black color looks really attractive, though note that the Columbia emblem in the center of the back is white and some wont like that its so noticeable. The polyester material is rather delicate so I always wash my in a mesh garment bag on Delicate cycle.  Colubia needs to make more colors of this shirt!",

        "First Columbia down jacket I bought. Red color in this jacket looks great. Down filling is enough for day with 10\u00b0F, snow and wind (usual day in Illinois). I am 5,10 and 180 pounds and the medium size fit perfect. It is warmer than the north face 550 down parka.",

I live in NorCal so we don\u2019t get 10 degree weather, but it does get down in the 30\u2019s and I\u2019m comfortable. I have not tried it in the mountains yet.

Definitely a purchase I don\u2019t regret.

No problem with Amazon\u2026.. just an unplannedRe packing and stop by the nearby UPS store.Have re ordered hoping the packer will read the ordered size\u2026. Please.",

        "This is unacceptable and now will have to deal directly with Columbia under Warranty and they will attempt to fix this, if they can't, Columbia will send it back to me. Worse case scenario, I will keep it regardless of these cosmetic imperfections. I'd probably never buy Columbia jackets ever again. My wife has 2 of them, this was my first one. Amazon kindly offered me a refund which I declined and decided to take my chances with Columbia directly. Will be out of a jacket for about 2-4 weeks and will have to pay for shipping expenses from my pocket. Amazon offered me some store credit or money back which I took. I have bought other winter jackets from Amazon which were Tommy Hillfiger and Mountain Warehouse ones and never had this kind of issues before. Overall, Quality on the jacket seems good enough and overall materials look and feel adequate despite the imperfections that came with. Jacket is very light which is perfect for someone who does activities outside in winter. QA could be better. Would Not recommend.",

        "Love the comfort waistband on these shorts. Love the style and all the pockets they have. Will be buying more from LEE brand.",
        "The comfort level of these shorts is outstanding. The fabric has just the right amount of stretch, allowing for unrestricted movement during any physical activity. Whether I'm hiking, cycling, or simply lounging around, the shorts never feel restrictive or uncomfortable. The waistband is adjustable and features a flex waist for a customizable fit, adding to the overall comfort factor.In terms of durability, the Lee Men's Extreme Motion Swope Cargo Shorts certainly impressed me. I have worn them on multiple occasions, and they have held up remarkably well. The construction feels solid, and the stitching is strong, ensuring that these shorts will withstand the test of time. Even after frequent use and washing, I have not noticed any signs of wear or tear.The cargo pockets are another notable feature of these shorts. They provide ample storage space for essentials like keys, a phone, or a small wallet. The pockets are deep enough to securely hold items, and the Velcro closures ensure that nothing falls out during physical activities or when you're on the move.The only reason I deducted one star from the rating is that, while the shorts are durable overall, the color tends to fade slightly after repeated washes. However, this is a minor drawback and doesn't significantly impact the functionality or overall appeal of the shorts.",
        "I\u2019m a 46 year old suburban dad who wears cargo shorts, New Balance shoes and dad hats. I know who I am, and am comfortable with that. There was a period when dads in cargo shorts was a running joke. But I\u2019ll take it; I\u2019m not giving up my cargo shorts for anything.These shorts are the very best of the best when it comes to practical utility. Affordable (often on sale), stretchy in the waist for those days I eat a big sandwich or two, and deep pockets for storing all kinds of stuff. They\u2019re even a little trim. I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d/170-175 lb with a 34 waist and I get these in a 33 for a nice comfy fit. Basically a man-purse you can wear.If someone tells me my shorts are anything less than awesome, I\u2019ll tell \u2018em I\u2019d care about their opinion but I\u2019m too busy stashing snacks in my awesome pockets. Peace.",
        "Got these on sale and glad I did.  Fit is great and really like pockets, including one for my cell phone.  Has a bit of give that makes them very comfortable.  Can't say on durability since new, but judging by construction expect them to be fine.",
        "I bought a pair a few weeks ago and love them so much I bought two more colors.  Very comfortable, strong and light weight material. The deep cell phone pocket on the right thy is a huge plus. No need to unbutton one of the larger pockets to get at it. No need to risk sitting on it and breaking it in a back pocket. The rest of the pockets are great to have if you are heading to the park or beach.",

I know your gonna say, I've probably got a gut, not really. I'm 5'5\" 31\" waist and stay pretty close to 145 lbs.

        "So, first of all, I am not a robot and I am not a paid reviewer.  I generally do not write reviews unless I am very, very pleased with positive remarks to make.  These Wrangler cargo pants are very lightweight and breathable, which is really great for work, or even a long walk across the hot parking lot.  The pockets and stitching are very durable.  These truly embody the best of what we can expect from the Wrangler brand.The fit is just about perfectly suited to what I expected in the waist size, and there is ample room for the boys to breathe down south and the seat seems to round out the cheeks without sag or wedgies.  The left cargo pocket has a handy top slip opening for smart phones, or it might even fit an aluminum can, but I have not actually tried that, yet.I would give these Six Stars, if I could.  The only concern I have is that the lightweight material might wear out a little bit quicker than a thicker cargo pants material, but I have worn and washed these pants four times so far and there is no evidence of wear at all.  Great Wrangler pants.",

        "The Ariat hoodie in a soothing shade of blue is a delightful addition to any casual wardrobe, especially for those who value comfort and style. Crafted from soft, high-quality fabric, it offers an exceptional level of warmth and coziness, making it perfect for chilly days. The hoodie's design strikes a balance between a relaxed fit and a flattering silhouette, suitable for various body types.One of the standout features of this hoodie is its durability. Despite its softness, the material holds up well to regular wear and washing, maintaining both its color and shape. This makes it a practical choice for everyday use.The blue color of the hoodie is vibrant yet versatile, easy to pair with jeans, leggings, or other casual bottoms. It also features the subtle yet recognizable Ariat logo, which adds a touch of elegance to the overall design.Overall, this Ariat hoodie is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a blend of comfort, style, and durability. Its warmth, softness, and appealing color make it a go-to item for both indoor lounging and outdoor activities.",
        "The unique patterns and accents add a touch of modern flair to the classic hoodie style. It's refreshing to see a brand infuse creativity into everyday casual wear, and Ariat has done just that with the Aztek design. It's a subtle yet stylish nod to the brand's commitment to both fashion and functionality.The fit is spot-on. The sweatshirt drapes comfortably without being too loose or too tight. The hood is generously sized, adding that extra level of coziness on chilly days. The overall design is not only fashionable but also functional, making it suitable for both casual outings and lounging at home.It has withstood multiple washes without losing its shape or vibrant color. The quality stitching and reinforced seams are a testament to the craftsmanship that Ariat is known for, ensuring that this sweatshirt will be a long-lasting addition to my wardrobe.",
        "Fits great and true to picture!",
        "I buy Ariat brand all of the time for my husband as we both wear it and absolutely love it. The quality is fabulous and the fabric is so comfortable. The fit is Always perfect. This is the area sweatshirt that I got him for Christmas this year and it did not disappoint! The fit is perfect for a big and tall guy",
        "Fits decent and feels good but very thin lightweight material.  Definitely not for those cold days, more of a windbreaker!!!",
        "I bought the large in my normal size with the Chimayo Navy pattern and it fit perfectly. The length fits my longer than average torso and the band around the waist is not so tight that it rides up on me like some sweatshirts. If you wish to have a more loose-fitting hoodie you could go up a size. Besides the length, I have had issues with other hoodies being too thick, and the hood itself being a constant reminder on my neck that it's there. With this hoodie its forgettable until you need it. The hoodie I bought is made up of 52% Cotton & 48% Polyester giving it a medium weight that is both stylish and practical.I probably would not buy this hoodie in one of the solid colors since I have many like it already, but the Southwestern pattern helps it stand out from the rest. Five stars from me given it's fit, warmth, and pattern.",
        "This is nice. Feels great",
        "It was very soft and fit perfect! Reccomend 100000%",

        "La sudadera es muy bonita, viene grande en comparaci\u00f3n a otras marcas",

        "Normalmente uso talla L, pero este modelo me qued\u00f3 s\u00faper bien en talla M, ya que es un poco m\u00e1s amplia, para que lo consideren"

        "The Dr. Scholl's Men's Athletic & Work Compression Over The Calf Socks have exceeded my expectations on multiple fronts, making them an absolute must-have for anyone seeking comfort, support, and relief from fatigue.The first standout feature is the impeccable design. The over-the-calf length ensures that these socks stay securely in place throughout the day. The compression level is just right \u2013 not too tight, yet offering substantial support. Whether I'm at work or engaging in athletic activities, these socks have proven their worth by significantly reducing fatigue and enhancing my overall comfort.The quality of these socks is truly commendable. They have shown remarkable durability, with no signs of wear even after repeated use and washing. The moisture-wicking properties keep my feet dry, a feature that's essential for all-day wear.What sets these socks apart is their versatility. Whether I'm on my feet for long hours at work or hitting the gym for a workout, they provide consistent comfort and support. The compression not only helps alleviate fatigue but also promotes better blood circulation, which is an added health benefit.The choice between 1 & 3 pair packs is convenient, catering to different needs. This flexibility ensures that I always have a fresh pair available when I need them.",
        "I absolutely love these socks! I had already purchased some elsewhere before ordering these and have tried them out for a few months now. They are very comfortable, on the thicker side and hug your feet in the right places. They don\u2019t fall down even when working out, hiking all day, & when hot and sweaty. They provide gentle compression. They hold up well with multiple washes\u2014shrink a little bit, but nothing extreme.  I wear a woman\u2019s size 11, which is a men\u2019s size 8. They fit just fine, but there is definitely plenty of stretch in the fabric left in the foot area to accommodate larger feet. They also make an XL size of these.",
        "socks are comfortable but pilling quite a bit after just one washing",
        "I like the fact that some areas on the socks have more compression than other areas.  Therefore, they are easier to put on and more comfortable to wear compared to other brands  I have purchased.  They also keep my feet warmer than the nylon compression stockings.",
        "Been looking for these, I purchased a pair many years ago and I know how good these socks are. I always look in stores but finally decided to try Amazon.",
        "The socks are comfortable and easy to put on, but they shed fibers too much",
        "After trying several brands of compression socks that were too tight, impossible to put on, and too short, I discovered these, and found them to be great. They are easy to get on, reach to the knees on a 6'1\" person, and though not super tight, they keep my legs from swelling. They are comfortable too. Highly recommended!",
        "Definitely like these socks lite compression, and very comfortable.",
        "Excellent fit and just the right compression.",
        "Very comfortable to wear all day. Soft to the touch and durable after several washes.",

        "I love comfortable socks. To be honest I did at first consider the price per pair but I liked the style of these and then read the reviews and I'm like ok I'll give them a shot. They are comfortable, stylish and I can wear to work or casual. Good  spandex. I bought about 6 or 7 pairs and I like them all.",
        "I am always on the lookout for good socks and I have bought my share of duds. For me, a sock has to be durable (not have holes after a few washes) have some sort of design on top (I live in Florida and wear shorts a lot) can breathe well, and are comfortable. But what is also of equal importance is they hold their shape. These socks do all of that. They are a little more expensive than most and if the day comes when they go on sale I will throw out all my other socks and stick with these! :)",
        "As the title suggests, these socks are awesome! They are super comfortable, fit well, and look darn good! Having the extra padding in the toe and heel is a great feature. And there is some added support in the arch area that is fantastic as well. I\u2019ve been wearing Stance socks for years and rarely do I stray from buying other socks. I have the Star Wars line of Stance. Got them in or around 2017. Still wear them, so they stand the test of time. I\u2019m more than sure that these will, too! Can\u2019t go wrong with Stance! Comfy! Nuff said! Buy \u2018em!!",
        "Got these as a gift for my guy friend who loves Stance socks. They're fitting, cute, and comfy. They definitely make a good gift",
        "While Stance socks can be a little pricey, you definitely get what you pay for.  These socks are so comfortable!",
        "Let me first say that socks are about the best clothing item one can buy online.  They obviously aren't something one would try on in a store, and reading other owners' reviews of them trumps what one could glean from touching them in person.  These Stance Joven's are one of my favorites in my sock drawer, and I tend to buy socks from a wide range of suppliers, rarely acquiring duplicates.  My favorite aspect is how they feel when on:  not too tight, not too loose, but like a comfortable, well-fitting glove for the foot.  There is some subtle padding in the right places, and the materials strike the right balance between being warm yet breathable.  This is truly a sock that is enjoyable to wear year round.I bought the Grey version and although it's a pretty good-looking sock, I don't like the color combo so much:  The white parts are straight up, cold white.  I wear size 9 (US) shoes and the L model works great for me.  I have had these for over 6 months and they are holding up well.",
        "Really comfortable",
        "Est\u00e1 marca es una de mis favoritas para medias, son muy c\u00f3modas.",
        "Another perfect pair of Stance socks to replace some worn out other pairs of socks.Stance socks are a tad more expensive but in my experience they fit perfectly, never fall down, stay dry, look good, and last for years. I haven't yet worn a pair out, and I got my first pair 3 years ago; they still look the same as they did after their first wash.",
        "Cosy, warm and comfortable and they stay up. Just right for these winter months, they are slightly thicker than cotton socks and thiner than traditional woollen ones.",

        "First let me say that these are extremely comfortable. The cotton is soft, and they are well made. The downside for me is that they do not have enough of a pouch to keep me in place. There isn\u2019t much of a contour to the pouch, so they actually push things out to the sides. I tried wearing these under some short shorts and knew I would have to return them or face some embarrassing situations.So if you are larger than average in that area, I would look elsewhere, but if these fit you and keep you covered up, you will love them.

Will be wearing them in preference to my conventional underwear in future . I will definitely be buying the same brand and design when the need arises .",
        "I never thought I'd find a g-string comfortable, but here we are. The pouch at the front rides a bit low, but otherwise the fit on these are true - whatever size you'd normally wear in a pair of jocks is probably right for these too. The string connecting the pouch to the waistband at the back is quite thin and easy to forget about after wearing for a few moments. If you're curious about trying this shape of underwear, these are an easy recommendation."

        "These are very comfortable socks that fit really wel. They do not ride down like others causing blisters on the back of the heels when running. They have held through washes and are well made.",
        "I\u2019ve had Balego socks for many years. They last a long time without wearing out too quickly and are super comfortable. The little lip helps it always stay above your shoe to prevent blisters."

        "My husband has only worn Thorlo socks in the past & it was time to try something different.  These socks have become his go to socks & they have held up well so far.  The XL for his size 16 shoe size was the right size & he says that they are comfortable.",
        "These are awesome socks.  Perfect size for wearing with shorts, though you can wear them with long pants also.  Not too long, not too short on the calf. They stay up and they keep your feet dry.  And as someone with large narrow feet (15B) I appreciate being able to get them in this size (description says 13-15 but package says 12-16).Since these socks are so good, they are either sold out due to high demand, or Gold Toe decided to stop making them.  That makes sense - make a perfect product that everyone loves,  and then stop making it.  I hope they'll have these back in stock soon.",
        "Gold Toe has a tough, long lasting sock. My 20 yr old is tough on everything.",
        "These socks are about the best extended size I've found..I have big feet, shoe size 14 extra wide.  Since these are just new, can't comment too much.  I wouldn't mind if they were even bigger, but these are OK and feel good.  Just have to see how they wear and react to washing/drying.",
        "The socks wear well and fit well.  Many white socks I have purchased are on the thin side.  These are a perfect, medium thickness socks.  Purchased multiple pairs of these Gold Toe socks years ago.  Finally wore the last pair out and replaced.  They have maintained the same level of quality.  I am pleased.",
        "cushioning is good, they don't \"thin out\" upon washing, tops not too tight.  Odd thing is that the package of 3 is more expensive but feels and looks the same as the package of 6, less expensive socks.",
        "Good socks",
        "I like these socks and the price is reasonable, however I don't love these socks. They seem to be made with too much elastic material and thus they are stretchable but they are also very confining and tight. I got the size required for my feet and the sock leave compression marks all over my ankles and lower calf. The make my leg hair itch because they are so tight. I've tried a larger side but then the foot section of the sock is too big for my size 13 feet. So the sock seems nice, durable but too stretchy and tight.",

        "I do not want to fault this jacket.  It has no shortcomings that I have found.  It is just not what I was hoping for.I do not care about the concealed carry feature.  I wanted a lined denim jacket and they are hard to find in tall sizes.  I was hoping that I would still be able to use the inside pockets to drop in a wallet or checkbook.  That is not practical with this jacket since the inside pockets have no bottoms.  Anything placed into them other than possible a firearm would have to be retrieved from behind the lining at the bottom.A firearm would apparently attach to the inside plastic strips that are sort of like Velcro.  This would attach with an accessories that is included with the jacket.  The downside to this is that the plastic strips are very noisy with about every movement.The denim used to make the jacket that I got is the type of denim that looks to me like the imported imitation of American denim.  It is not a denim look match with jeans and other clothing.  It does not look like the denim pictured on the online catalog.  The collar is corduroy, the jacket is well made and the fit for me is correct for an XL Tall.I use to carry a concealed weapon when I was a police officer.  If I were to carry a concealed weapon again this is not the way that I would do it.  I would stay with the high rise belt holster.  I will however keep the jacket since it is comfortable and well made.",
        "I bought four of these as Christmas gifts for my husband, our son, son-in-law and grandson. Two X-large and two long-large. They said they are just right and very comfortable and the large pockets allow them to carry things. They also look good on them. I would highly recommend this jacket for any man who likes to look smart and comfortable and needs a place to store extra things.",
        "It looks nice, fits nice. But if you got it for the main purpose if conceal carry...I\u2019m a little dissatisfied with it. It comes with a universal holster (which is nice) but it attaches to Velcro on the inside pockets. So if you attach it on the inside of the pocket it holds my compact SA:XD9, but it becomes super bulky and just looks ugly. It looks better if I let the gun drop to the bottom of the pocket, but in an emergency it\u2019ll take a longer to withdraw my firearm. The inside of the jacket is thin, it feels too thin actually, I feel like it\u2019ll tear up quick, unfortunately I still haven\u2019t worn it out in public because of the heat. It\u2019s summer and our weather has been in the triple digits. So I will be updating later on to see how it lasted.For now my only problem is the CCW pocket, when carrying conceal it is WAY TOO bulky;And my only concern is that the inside material may be too thin and might not last long.But it is Wrangler material and I\u2019m going to give it the benefit of the doubt. Overall when I don\u2019t have my firearm concealed it looks nice and fits nice. Length of jacket is ever so slightly under my belt. It\u2019s perfect.",
        "This jacket is very comfortable and fashionable. It fits true to size but it sits nice and loose.  It doesn\u2019t bind at all with arms raised or outstretched. What you would expect from Wrangler quality clothing. Buy with confidence.",
        "First off it is a nice blue jean jacket. But if you are wanting it for carry purposes  don't do it. This has the worst carry system that I have ever seen.  The provided holster is total garbage. There's not a pocket for the carry system.  If the gun was to come out of holster which is held by velcro, the weapon will fall all the way to the bottom of jacket. Jacket has to be taken off to retrieve weapon.It's a very nice lined jacket, but it's just that.",
        "Couldn't be happier with product. It's perfect.",
        "At first glance it looked great.  Then I tried it on.  I kept thinking, \"Why is the chest so stiff?\"  Well it is because there are big hard plastic velcro pads sewn into it (for the included holster to stick to).  Why they didn't reverse it and sew the \"soft side\" of velcro to the jacket and make the holster with a piece of the \"hard side\", I'll never know.  My pistol kept slipping out of the holster anyway and falling all the way down inside the jacket to the waist.  They should have sewn the pockets, not just had them open all the way inside down to the waist.  Lastly it was super uncomfortable! So stiff! After about 20 minutes of trying it out, I put it back in the package for return.",
        "Great fit for him",
        "Me sorprendi\u00f3 cuando me llego, no esperaba que tuviera 2 bolsillos especiales y dedicados para portar 2 armas cortas. Viene con un porta arma para colocarlo en alguno de los 2 bolsillos dedicados para armas.Me gust\u00f3 la apariencia de la chamarra, no me gusto mucho el forro y no me gusto nada lo de las armas.Deber\u00edan de poner en la descripci\u00f3n chamarra lista para portar armas o algo as\u00ed.",
        "Bien",
        "Fits large, probably should have gone with medium.We live in Canada - my husband got a kick out of the concealed carry. BTW - totally ILLEGAL in Canada.",
        "Fits like dream.  Even in the arms which is rare for me.  Highly recommend.  I didn't want or like the conceal carry feature so I removed the stitching from the thick velcro plastic sheets from the inner pockets that made the jacket stiff and uncomfortable. After that the jacket was absolutely perfect.",

        "Bought this shirt for a wedding that I was attending. It fitted and looked great!",
        "This is a well made shirt.However the neck, at 16 1/2, has a difficult to button/closure (maybe the button hole is a bit too small?).  The material is very, very light weight and for dressing up, one would likely need to wear a tshirt, under the white shirt, as it is a bit see through.  The shoulders and sleeves fit as expected.I like their brand, so I will return it and try another model of their product.",
        "Looking sharp for me. Lots of good comments",
        "This shirt's fit and material is awesome. I am on the chubby side with a bigger neck and chest. My size is 18 neck 34/35. So when I buy regular fit dress shirts, it fits me like a refrigerator box. The slim fit by Van Heusen is way to go. Add in the material on this shirt is extremely comfortable and enjoy the stretch.",
        "The shirt is nice. My son is 6' and 220 lbs. It fits him perfectly. This will be baggy on a thin guy. This is perfect for someone who is thick.I am very disappointed it doesn't have a pocket. My son specifically wanted a pocket. The pic shows a pocket! Yes the fine print in the description says no pocket, but isn't that what pics are for so I don't have to read the 1000 word description?",
        "My husband wore this under his tux for our wedding and it prevented any sweat stains. Love it. Go get it dry cleaned.",
        "This slim fit Van Heusen has a fair price, but the feel of a fancy shirt. It's lightweight and has a bit of a glossy sheen. Despite all the negative reviews about the cut being too bulky in the middle, this fits me to a T. I'm pretty slim -- at 6' 140# -- and, while slightly generous in shoulder width and sleeve length, the shirt tapers at the waist very nicely. If tail length is the problem, SHIRT STAYS are a cheap, simple solution. Some reviews also complained about wrinkles. Well, DRY CLEAN -- because yeah, if you're tossing a cotton/poly shirt into a washer and dryer, it will get wrinkly. I pressed the shirt off using an IRON without any problem. In fact, this shirt seemed easier to press than others. Great shirt. Good deal.",
        "Es una camisa para uso diario ya que es de poliester y un poco de algod\u00f3n, por lo que dura bastante la tela. El ajuste de talla es el adecuado.",
        "Perfect fit, price, and quality. Will buy again, different colour though.Arrived day after order.",
        "All American shirts run a little big, and \"form fitting\" does not mean it will fit a person who is in shape. I bought this shirt to wear under my suit, so as long as it was comfortable and looked good, I was happy. It worked great.",
        "Volveria a comprar camisas de esta marca, el corte fue excelente",
        "My husband has this shirt in a different colour that I bought at a store here in Canada. I\u2019ve not been able to find another locally. This arrived today and fits perfectly! Highly recommend. Beautiful colour as well!"

        "I bought for my husband who is in a physical rehab facility. He needs something that he can move around in comfortably, but still look decent.  This shirt does both.  The color is extremely flattering on him.  I have washed and dried in dryer and it comes out looking great.",
        "Been wearing for years. I wear xxl for bed time. Xl during the day with my jeans. I have almost the majority of colors. Heres some helpful details\u2026 almost every single color of these shirts is different in material and color than the pictures. The material on some of them is the true and trusted thickness and softness. Some material and colors are absolutely not. Thinner and more paper like and cheap. Colors are brighter on some. Muted in others. Some are cut boxier. Some longer. This is comparing same size shirts here. Its a hit or miss. But since I know which ones are always consistent, I tend to stick with those.The spruce green, light burgandy, denim, grape, pepper, and crimson coral type colors are great. I like the faded look to them. They are always thick and smooth in texture.  The rest are not. The black and navy color is boxy and cheaper in material. Which was disappointing because i love those colors.Couple more things to note: the large is too small for me. The xl large is a touch too loose. I wish that was more in the middle size wise. Also, if this doesnt say prime on it, you will get this from some vendor. This is a huuuuge difference in quality. For 90 percent of orders that fall into this category, ive gotten shirts that arrived damp and shipped with no plastic insert. Wrinkled. Some even looked like it was worn once. Not to mention they ship them out when they feel like it. So ive wait a week plus for them. I avoid those colors. Oh, and they never smell right. Just smells off..They also dont shrink very much. They get a touch shorter. Ive had these in a hot dryer too.I keep coming back for the material. Softness. Not shrinking and the awesome colors. But best of all these shirts are not short. They cover the butt.My favorite color by far is pepper and denim. They go great with jeans. It always looks good on anyone. It has a cool faded look to them and isnt heathered which I don\u2019t like. If you have larger arms and a wider back and want a loose fit and normally wear a large then get an xl. Otuerwise stick to your normal size.I also have about ten in long sleeve. Same review applies to those as well.Btw, im a woman and wear these. Womens tshirts are not cut right in my opinion. Lastly, if you cook in these shirts, somehow oil splatters show up even if you didnt cook with oil. I Cant explain this , but they dont go away with washing. I always wear an apron. Hope this reviews helps someone!",

        "These boxers are super comfortable and keep me cool even in the Phoenix heat. I\u2019ve been wearing boxer briefs for a long time, but decided to try these after a terrible run with non-cotton pair of thieves boxers that felt hot and constricting all the time.

        "Comfortable, not tight at all, soft material absolutely perfect, Ill be purchasing more no doubt.",
        "These boxers are made with high-quality materials that ensure both comfort and durability.The Solids are made from 100% cotton, while the Heathers are a blend of 75% cotton and 25% polyester. The Dunk Stripes have a composition of 55% cotton and 45% polyester. Regardless of the style, these boxers are incredibly soft and gentle on the skin. The ComfortSoft cotton used in their construction is truly remarkable, providing a level of softness that you can feel.A feature of these boxers is the comfort flex waistband. It is not only soft and stretchable but also moves with you, ensuring a snug fit that doesn't lose its shape even after multiple washes. The tagless design adds an extra layer of comfort, eliminating any itchiness or irritation that can often be associated with traditional boxers.I was also impressed by the sturdy and long-lasting double-stitched seams. These boxers are built to withstand regular wear and tear, making them a worthwhile investment. The generous cut of these boxers allows for easy movement and ensures that you can go about your day with ease.",

        "Wanted to provide a review to compare these against other socks on Amazon and give some specifics that are lacking from the description. I\u2019ve purchased the Adidas Copa 4, Adidas Copa 3 with Traxion, and Adidas rivalry; in addition to the Puma Liga.These Pumas are going to be most similar to the Copa 4 because they provide a soft, padded sensation that doesn\u2019t have grip like the Copa 3, but instead makes your foot feel more snug in your boot since the Pumas have added padding. However, these are very slightly less padded and less bulky than the Copa 4. So if you don\u2019t like too much padding, the Pumas are a nice middle ground. The Adidas Rivalry are very basic thin socks that are fine if you need lightweight socks, but I prefer more padding that improves lockdown in my size 12 boots.The Pumas are on the thick side, but they have a nice mesh material on the back of the calf on the sock that makes them feel pretty good in the summer and you don\u2019t feel too hot. They also have a vented mesh on the top of the foot that makes the foot a little more comfortable even with the surrounding padded toe and heel.Overall I think these are great socks that are softer than Adidas Copa in terms of material, but a little lighter in terms of padding. If you like a padded a sock like a Copa. I think you will like these too. I\u2019ve seen some people say they are a bit warm for their liking which I can understand because of the plusher material than the Copas, but so far hasn\u2019t been an issue for me.They are long socks and easily go over my knees, but I don\u2019t mind. Overall good fit for size 12 wide feet. Only worn in one match so far, so can\u2019t speak to long term durability yet!",
        "Same socks you would buy in store - arrived quickly - true fit",
        "Great pair of Puma soccer socks! Very long length perfect for pulling up to the thighs and folding. Fits my shin guards well and does not show that they are a light blue color. Overall great socks and will be playing many games in these in the future!",
        "Bought these for my 11 year old son. They are holding up great but more of a fall season sock as they are very thick and warm.",
        "Son needed school soccer socks. Met expectations color and fit.",
        "It\u2019s thick it\u2019s comfortable very stretchy and long I slide tackle a lot and no tears so definitely stands the durability test on my behalf",
        "Comfortable and much easier to get on than other brands. Good cushioning on the feet",
        "These socks are the color and size described. They are ok but they arrived with a hole. The sock with the hole was placed behind the perfect sock so it wasn\u2019t apparent until I opened the package. Sadly, I won\u2019t be able to return the pair because my son had a game today and will wear them with the hole. I will need to mend it later.",

        "The range of movement in these is phenomenal! These jeans use this special split seam thing in the crotch area that allows for a much great range of movement than any regular pair of jeans.I went rock climbing in these and completely forgot I was in jeans. I couldn't ask for more.I also bicycle in these daily; their range of motion makes riding more comfortable than most jeans. (The material is still denim so they're nowhere near as comfortable as proper riding gear for long rides.)I wear these everywhere.The pair I had before these were $170 Joe's. While these are not quite as comfortable or good looking as the Joe's, the range of motion and durability makes these by far my preferred jeans.Pros:- Range of motion (!!!)- Comfortable- Looks decent- Durable- Good sized pockets (big enough for my iPhone 6 to not get jammed into my hip while I'm riding my bike.)Cons:- I've had better looking jeans (although these aren't bad by any means)- Slightly too long in the legs.",
        "As a previously sponsored athlete of one of the greatest clothing made for outdoors, I bore witness to the decline in quality and ultimately stopped purchasing.",
        "(Review by Erica's husband.)  I love these jeans.  They've been my go-to jeans for 5 years, for work and home.  I've got pretty big thighs (it's all muscle, I swear) and these are much more comfortable than most other jeans, and look good too.  The fabric has some stretch, and they are gussetted (a different cut that's more flexible), and the thighs are a little looser.  Put it all together, and you get super comfortable jeans.)  One pair (of the about 7 I've bought) has a weird problem with the fly -- the fabric tends to kind of open up, showing the zipper; I have to iron those occasionally.  Otherwise, perfect.",
        "I am 5'7 and about 160, I need athletic cut jeans or else my thighs, hips and butt cause most jeans to be very tight... while the waist is lose.Pros:- Great color- Gusset is awesome!!- Fabric really moves with you and is not restrictive- Sizing is accurate- Very comfortable, I feel like I could actually workout in theseCons- The straight leg is a very wide opening, at least 2 inches bigger than my Levis straight leg, so kinda looks like bell bottomsI really wanted to keep these jeans for how awesome they fit but the leg opening was just too big. Maybe for the taller gents this wouldn't be an issue, but for use vertically challenged guys they are not flattering. I am returning them. Since this is my style preference I still gave four stars.",
        "If you're like me, you've spent decades perfecting your head kick, and walk the streets waiting for something to break off where you have the opportunity to legally spin-kick a gang-banger or thug in the face.  But if you wear conventional jeans, you can't lift your leg up high enough due to restrictions in the crotchal region.  What then?!!  You'd have to just leg kick somebody or punt to the groin, and that won't make for a great YouTube video.  Fortunately, there are Prana Axiom Jeans!  The gusseted crotch and stretchable fabric is made for rock climbing--which also makes them perfect for throwing head kicks.  And they look like regular casual jeans, so no one will expect what you've got waiting on them.  And if by chance you got taken to the ground, the extra flexibility is good for triangle chokes.  These jeans look great, are well made, and are the next best thing since Chuck Norris Action Jeans.  Get a pair and kick someone in the face today!",
        "I have to say, these are my favorite jeans. They are comfortable and the material is light enough that it isn't hot in the summer and in the winter, they don't let the wind in.My issue is, and these are my 4th pair, the gusset always wears out where the denim folds. Maybe I don't have enough of a 'thigh gap' for the denim not to rub. I can get maybe.. 1 full year (in days) of wear before a hole is worn thru. Adding a patch doesn't work because of the constant movement of walking. At full price, this is not really sustainable for me, so now i'll only purchase them when they're on sale.",
        "These jeans are NOT Axioms. They are a completely different shape. Much baggier with a longer rise. I ended up throwing them away as I had had them hemmed so would be unable to return them. Too bad because Axioms are now really hard to find and I have been wearing them for years.",
        "material is durable, so they should hold up well over time",
        "Great pants, good quality although I had to get them hemmed they only came in 34-inch inseam/leg length.",
        "I was hesitant to buy these, but I must say they are probably the best Jeans I have ever worn.  They are very comfortable, and seem well built.Pros:Super comfortable (feels like they were built just for me)StretchyLarge front pockets (like, 8 inch deep, 6 inch wide)Well builtSoft DenimGood colouringCons:I wanted to buy another pair but they are $$$ when not on sale",

The price was fair and reasonable for the quality of the shorts. I am planning to order another pair very soon.",

If I get the standard size for my waist, the thigh/upper leg area is super tight, and it's hard to even bend or squat in jeans or shorts.  If I go up a size it tends to be a little too big.  With these comfort flex shorts, it's like a half size extra and it makes it much more comfortable and gives that little extra around the thigh area.My only gripe about these is that since there is a little extra in the waist it sort of bunches in the back causing them to shift and sometimes fall a little.",

        "The shirts came with a few loose threads, but they seemed remnants of manufacturing, not anything that would damage the structural integrity of the shirt.I purchased these to add iron on vinyl to. My parents can never remember what I'm getting my doctorate in (a bunch of long boring words, as they tell me) and as a joke I wanted to put it on some shirts. I got a black one and a red one. The black one went well, but the black color where the iron had sat seemed slightly lighter (20 seconds in each spot, over a teflon sheet, stupid expensive Rowenta on the cotton setting). I figured that's fine, it's just a joke anyway and I'm sure the rest of the shirt will fade in a couple washes. On to the red shirt! I ironed the section where I would place the vinyl and the red seemed to get slightly darker and the color go from Christmas red to more pink. Giving the situation the benefit of the doubt, I assumed this was due to a little steam coming out (even though I had the steam off, I hadn't emptied the reservoir). I put the vinyl and teflon down, pressed for 20 seconds over sections of the design, removed the teflon and found the red dye to be quite unhappy with what just happened (much closer to pink, and actually lighter after waiting a few minutes). Red is the least stable of colors on a chemical level but I didn't think a few seconds of heat would do what it did in a cotton shirt made for durability. I'm just going to pretend the iron spots were intentional, to further the joke somehow. However, I wanted to leave a review with this information in case someone plans to use these shirts for vinyl transfer--the dye may not cooperate with higher heat applications.",

        "Edit: 1/15/2019:I've edited this review multiple times over the years. These socks are obviously popular with more people than just diabetics. If you have wide feet or overall big feet, these socks and their past \"extra give\" they have were an excellent choice as your daily sock.This is the part we've all noticed: The blue stitch on the toes has turned into a gray/brown stitch. The gray/brown stitch pairs are not as wide, not as long and don't have as much give in them. I even tried ordering some from Walmart's website since they too show the blue stitch on the toes. Those came right before Christmas 2018 and were gray/brown.I decided to order these newest ones from Amazon because the description and sizes have changed. According to my order and this product's page, I ordered the Men's size 12-15.Here are four shoes I currently wear and their sizes: Brooks Ghost Goretex size 12, Brooks Bedlam size 11.5, New Balance 990v4 size 11 4E, New Balance 1080v8 size 11 2E. That puts me in an uncomfortable position since I'm just below the 12-15 group and my feet are wide. But because all of the recent Medipeds have been to small, I thought the 12-15 would fix that problem.They arrived on 1/14/2019. I want to repeat this part ... the order says, \"Men's, shoe size 12-15\". The ones that came have the brown/gray stitch instead of the blue and the packaging says, \"Unisex, shoe size 7-12.\" This is obviously wrong and the unisex part bothers me more than the wrong size being sent. As gray/brown would be a unisex color. The new ones don't fit any better than the previous gray/brown stitch socks and even worse, they are longer by about an inch than the previous gray/brown ones I received. They are not wider at all.Yet another return of these once great socks. I did test the unisex part out. My wife wears a 9 in women's shoes and these socks fit her very well. Think about that. I wear an 11-12 with some requiring extra wide widths in men's and they fit a women's size 9. Hopefully, Medipeds will realize unisex socks aren't a good idea, especially from the male side of it. I'm now going to look around and see if I can't find a different brand that makes a good, stretchy sock that doesn't bind and fits the bigger end of foot sizes. I lowered the score to 3 stars from 4, they were originally a 5._______________________Edit: 11/14/2018:These are my favorite socks despite not being a diabetic. I like the non-binding of them and what I would call a looseness that doesn't bunch up. I ordered a new 8 pack two weeks ago. I probably have 16 pairs of them before ordering this pack. This pack comes and I instantly noticed something was different. The blue medipeds stitch on the toe is now tan. Sounds petty but everybody in my family wears black socks. Mine were easy to keep separate because of the blue lettering. Then, I put them on. They're still comfortable but they're not as loose feeling. I'm taking a star off my original review which you can read below the line. My shoe size is New Balance 11 2E or 11.5 in any other brand.I'll start by saying I'm not a diabetic, but I've had numerous leg injuries, work on my feet quite a bit and I've had feet problems similar to diabetics. Most socks like to leave their band-print on my ankle. As the weather gets colder, and especially this year, since we're going to be working up in the Smoky Mountains after the forest fires, I knew I needed to get some fairly warm socks that don't cut my circulation off.I own quite a few different pairs of these types of socks.Probably 10 pairs of the Dr. Scholl's Diabetic Quarter SocksFour or five pairs of the Gold Toe SoleUtion Quarter SocksFour pairs of Gold Toe Fairway Tab Quarter SocksThe Dr. Scholl's were my favorites for a year or so, but they've lost their shape and they slide up and down on my feet. The Gold Toe SoleUtion are very good, but if you've shopped for them, you know how hard they can be to find. The Gold Toe Fairway Tab is also a good option. The advantage to it is it has a pull tab on the back of the sock (back of ankle), which stops the elastic from binding into your leg, but ...A few months ago, my wife and I went on a weekend vacation and I, like most men, forgot my socks. I found a two-pack of these MediPEDS at a drugstore and couldn't believe how good they felt. They have more all-around cushion than those listed above, the SoleUtion has a better cushioned sole, but not up around the ankles. Admittedly, I paid around fifteen dollars for the two pairs at the drugstore. So, like most of you, I was going through my family's Christmas list and suddenly saw these, 8 pairs for twenty dollars. I ordered them while purging my cart of everyone's Christmas gifts and sending those to the \"save for later\" area. They're really good socks, very comfortable and more importantly at this time of the year, they are easily the warmest of the ones I've listed above. We're going to be at 26 high today, on a mountain, with 20-30 miles per hour winds. I'll love them even more after today is over. Oh and I marked \"Fit as expected\" since I already have two pairs. I might would lean towards \"Somewhat large\", which is what I needed. I don't think it's enough to change the size you order unless you're right on the borderline of the size chart. I see it more as more room for my foot to move around.",
        "Nice material, fits perfect.",
        "I am very pleased with this choice of socks. They fit perfectly and do not bind or cut f circulation when my feet and ankles swell up. The best socks I have ever ordered.",
        "Super buena calidad y precio",
        "Excellent fit.  Medipeds are the cat's meow!",
        "Bought these for my husband who is diabetic. After having bought other brands and the band always goes after not much use. He had these socks for a few months and they are DEFINITELY THE BEST WE HAVE HAD. Will buy more eventually when they need  replacing. Great value."

        "I can't say enough good things about the Pro Club Men's Heavyweight Cotton Short Sleeve Crew Neck T-Shirt! This shirt is an absolute gem. It's not your run-of-the-mill tee; it's heavyweight cotton that feels incredibly soft yet sturdy, so it stands up to daily wear and countless washes without losing its shape or color. The fit is spot on, and the crew neck design is timeless. I've stocked up on several colors, and they've become my daily go-to shirts. Whether I'm dressing up or keeping it casual, this tee never lets me down. If you're on the hunt for a high-quality, comfortable, and stylish shirt that won't break the bank, do yourself a favor and grab a few of these \u2013 you won't regret it!",
        "The first thing that impressed me about this t-shirt is the quality of the material. The thickness of the fabric not only gives it a luxurious feel but also ensures durability. The cotton used is soft against the skin, providing comfort throughout the day. I'm not a fan of drapey or thin t-shirts that hug in all the wrong places. This shirt is the opposite of that.",
        "After reading all the reviews I was still a little hesitant - well being one of the big boys it sucks trying to find shirts that don't fit properly in the length. These have perfect length - absolutely love this shirt. Bought just the one to see how it would fit, now I will be buying several more in the variety of colors that are offered.So, as I mentioned the LENGTH is pretty much perfect (yes there is some ambiguity to that and what is perfect for me may be too short/long for others). The best way to describe the length is: (1) it's NOT so long that you will be confused as a chulo or brother with the t-shirts that could be a dress. (2) It IS long enough that you do not try to figure out if it is actually a TALL or notThe THICKNESS of the material comes into question. If I were to consider myself a t-shirt guru (and I actually do) the thickness of these shirts is somewhat exaggerated. Having read the other reviews before buying I expected the shirts to be really thick and heavy. The reality is that they are a high-quality t-shirt. (high-quality t-shirt . . . is that an oxymoron?)No, it is not an under shirt; similar to the 3 pack white FOTL or Hanes. Therefore, why would you expect it to feel like one. Quite honestly, the thickness reminds me of Nautica t-shirts (of which I paid $55 for one stinking t-shirt). Long story short --> this t-shirt is thicker than a plain white under tee but is by no means any thicker than a higher quality t-shirtNow to the NECK - it is a bit snug. This shirt has become my most snug as far as neck opening goes.Hers' the problem with this - how do you subjectively explain the fit/feel? I happen to like a tighter neck (coming from someone who HATES V-neck shirts - so you know I like the neck area a little tighter than most) but this shirt does make me give the neck opening a little pull/stretch every so often. BUT, if you remember the beginning of my review I wrote that I will be buying more of the shirts. So, the snugness of the neck is not so much of a deterrent that it will stop me from buying more.I can say this, if you do not like the neck opening to be snug then you really should consider not buying this brand of shirt.All-in-all I am very pleased with the purchase of this ProClub shirt. The length is perfect and the 2XL part fits well too. The pricing of the shirts - $9.99 to $13.99 is a great price for these quality shirts.",
        "Thick, heavy fabrics - well made. Sleeves and neck were tight on me though. 6\u2019-0\u201d, 205 lbs.",
        "I m a big guy so this was a good fit not tight and just long enough so nothing shows I'll countue to buy",
        "Thick material is nice, feels very well built. I don't like the cut, but could be me. First one was a bit too small as the heavy material doesn't stretch like a normal T-shirt, second was a size larger and fit better but was ridiculously long. I wouldn't wear this shirt personally but I was impressed with the quality. I may just have someone hem the bottom a few inches for me.",
        "Nice ,thick, good quality !",
        "So I decided I would try these t shirts out and..1. They run a bit small so I went for the xl2. I have washed and dried it twice on delicate and it shrunk. So now it fits like a Medium.Honestly I like the thickness of the material just wish it would have never shrunk.",

It makes for a sloppy look. Not a flattering cut at allI could take in the bottom 2 buttons 3\" and it would then for well, but not be centered at the front. This should probably be marked as a portly sized garment. It is not cut for average or athletic guys.It's a shame because it's otherwise a nice heavy warm coat that could have been fantastic",
        "Overall the coat is nicely made, and well styled. My chief complaint is the lack of pockets for a coat of this price. There are no interior pockets, only the two handwarmers at the outer sides. The faux shearling collar is just OK and not really very stylishly cut. On the other hand, the coat material and general cut of the coat itself is very handsome. It seems warm but just a little more attention to the design would have garnered a better review from me.",

Thick, bold color, stitching good and length. Ordered XL for him and he\u2019s 6 ft 4, 210lbs and they fit well. Definitely ordering more soon!",

The big challenge for me is finding something that doesn't fit me like a garbage bag with arms sewn on. If it fits in the shoulders the body usually doesn't and vice versa.  I have been looking for something midweight with a hood to replace my old down Columbia that I got for 25 cents with a hole in it from a thrift store.  I have worn it for about 8 years.

That being said I would still almost buy it because the hood is so insanely good.  Like so good you want to get a job on a glacier cruise just to use it.  It is THAT amazing compared to all the other hoods.Patagonia Fitz Roy Hoody M(didn't have a large) Fit well for a medium but still would take a large. Puffy. $400.Outdoor Research Coldfront Hoodie.

Fit was OK but ultimately felt too light and flimsy for what you were paying. $100-$200.Synthetic FillColumbia Labyrinth Loop. Large. I decided to give this a try because the Omni-Heat is the same principal as emergency blankets trapping heat.  Down can get kind of useless when it gets wet and you can't get it dry and I figured even if all else fails I will get reflected body heat.  The fit is very good for the price. Not baggy but room for my layers and movement underneath.  Only the Arcteryx and Narrona fit me comparably. It has cinch around the waist that not all the other jackets have and the hood cinch isn't terrible.  It will fit best with a beanie and cotton hood underneath as it is quite large and needs an adjustment like on the Buck Butte.  If I could change the hood I would but have seen worse on pricier jackets. Also, the reflective material inside I would prefer to be silver but I guess I just have to let my inner rapper shine. I got black and there is almost a two tone color because it has two different materials on the sleeves, ribs and body but it looks good and is subtle. Pockets are big enough to hold winter buckskin gloves and have room for a beanie and your hands. No inside pockets. Overall for the pricepoint of $139 I am pleasantly surprised with what it is.  8.5/10.  I used some of the money I saved to buy a new Kurhatic trapper hat.  It also seems like it is actually warmer than my old Columbia down that is heavier and I spend a lot of time in ice rinks.  Overall I would say I am very happy with this purchase.Tommy Hilfiger Hooded puffer jacket.

I would suggest if they say a size stick with it. Overall, I will keep it since I got a deal but, it doesn't look as bulky in pictures as it does in person . I'm sure it will definitely keep you warm.",

        "I'm 6 feet tall and 225 pounds, and I recently got these pants on sale from Amazon for a great price. I'm really happy with them! They're very comfortable and stylish, and they make me look slim. I even got a compliment on them the other day!The pants are made from a soft, breathable fabric that's perfect for lounging around or running errands. They have a relaxed fit through the hips and thighs, but they taper slightly at the ankles to create a flattering silhouette. The elastic waistband is comfortable and doesn't dig in, and the pockets are deep enough to hold my phone and keys.I've been wearing these pants for a few weeks now, and they've held up well. They've machine washed and dried multiple times without any fading or shrinking. I'm definitely going to be buying more of these pants in the future!I highly recommend the Under Armour Men's Armourfleece Straight Leg Pant to anyone looking for comfortable, stylish, and durable pants. They're a great fit for men of all sizes, and they're sure to make you look your best.",

        "I've found myself wearing these more and more.On the up side, they fit great and are super comfortable. They've also stayed remarkably color-fast even after dozens of washings.On the down side, repeated washing and drying (even per the instructions) is causing some fatigue in the elastic, so they're slowly stretching out and not fully coming back.When they finally die (and no jean lives forever), I will definitely get these same ones again.",
        "I got these for my 6'4\" partner who has a tough time finding jeans that are long enough - it was the same story with these given the 32 inseam, though they don't look so short as to be awkward around the ankles, and he will be able to pull it off with the right shoes. He plans to wear these to work on casual days, and said that they were a nice comfortable material with enough stretch to fit his larger thighs. His one complaint was that the bottom of the jeans seem a little baggier compared to the photo, but he is used to more skinny fits so this may just be a feature of the 'Classic' style advertised. Overall a good solid black pair of jeans that don't look too emo, and don't have any cheesy bells and whistles like distressing/fading, so they're ok to wear for both inside and outside the office.",

Also, the fit is loose too.  The color is good.  I'm not sure if this specific jean warrants the high price, but it's a nice pants to wear."

        "Really nice sweater. Cost efficient, good quality, I\u2019m curious to see how it holds up over time for the price.I\u2019m 6\u20193, 210 lbs, got a XL and it fits as an oversized relaxed fit. If you want something more snug, order your original size. I\u2019m in fairly good shape and have an athletic build. This is not tight at all with my current purchase.Definitely recommend.",
        "Stop right here, you will probably not find a better sweatshirt anywhere at these prices and the best news is they are from a company like Hanes. As prices of everything spiral upward out of control I was surprised but a bit apprehensive about ordering these. Similar sweatshirts with store brands can cost as much as thirty to even fifty bucks, how good could these possibly be at between twelve and fifteen bucks?  The answer is, great.  They are traditional in every way, thick and warm without being bulky, lined with soft fleecy material, strong elastic at the cuffs and a collar that will hold its shape, and a wide variety of colors including brighter individualistic shades, a decided turn away from the drab dark earth tones most companies offer to men.WHAT I LIKEThe variety of shades and hues is high on my list. I am so tired of companies that think men only wear drab dark colors. Thank you Hanes for letting me express myself the way I want to.  I also like that these are the ideal weight for multi-season wear. They are just slightly lightweight enough to be able to wear them over a tee shirt for layering, something important in the climate zone where I live. And they are made very well, I do not look or feel like I am wearing an under fifteen buck sweat shirt.MINOR DETAILSNone of these things would keep me from buying several more of these but I should point them out. One is that the tag is rather stiff and chafes at the neck. That\u2019s not major because I can easily cut it off and I suspect it will soften after a few washings. The other thing is that the neck seems very slightly high in the front compared to other similar sweatshirts. I think that will probably loosen up after a while but for a crew neck it seems a little constraining, men with larger necks might want to take note.  And one final thing, I am very much against companies charging different prices for their different colors when the product is otherwise identical. It doesn\u2019t cost them any more and it seems materialistic to base their price on how trendy one shade may be over another.YES NO MAYBEThis is a definite yes for me to the point I already have finger poised on the buy button to get several more. It is so nice when prices are going ballistic to find something that is a real value.",
        "This is a thick and substantial long sleeve sweatshirt that feels very warm, soft, and comfortable. The material feels like it's made of good quality and I expect it to last a long time. Can't beat the price, either.",
        "I ordered one of these, in black, to check it out. Liked it enough to order another one in charcoal. Note that although they say these are 50/50, they seem to vary by color. My black is 100% cotton, the charcoal is 50/30 cotton/polyester. My wife bought a blue one and it's 50/50. My recommended size is L but I bought XL's because I like them big and loose. Sizing seems about normal. Compared with a couple of Nike $40 sweatshirts I have, these are not as supple and soft, as you might expect, but for the price, I think they are just fine. Very comfortable.",
        "Good quality, thicker than most. The sweatshirts run VERY big.  I bought a Large and an XLarge. The XL looks like an XXL or even bigger. These are the exact measurements of both sizes when spread-out and measured flat.Large= 25\u201d chest from underarm to underarm / 29\u201d back length / 24.5\u201d from underarm to end of wrist cuff. Large looks like extra large or even bigger.XL= 28\u201d chest  / 29.5\u201d back length/ 24.5\u201d arm length (underarm to end of wrist cuff.I returned the XL. After wash and medium-heat dryer, the chest measurement of the Large is 24.5\u201d  Nice sweatshirt.",
        "Very warm and comfortable sweatshirt.  65 cotton and 35 poly regardless of the numbers in the product description.  Not bulky so you can wear under a shirt jacket or motorcycle jacket without an issue.  Much warmer than a 90% cotton sweatshirt.  Can't beat the price either.  Sizing runs large as others have noted.  5'8\" 175 and went with a M - perfect fit.",
        "This sweatshirt is just fine. Thick and heavy, great for cold weather. Fits well and has no issues with the fabric that I can tell. Certainly expect this to last quite some time. Would recommend.",
        "I was hoping for a slim fit. Even for small they seem big.",
        "This is a good quality very comfortable sweater. I am very pleased with it and wear it often. It is a medium weight I would say. It is heavier than some similar sweaters available for similar prices.It's a great buy for the price.",

Not too heavy or too light and seems well made.  The zippers on the pockets is not necessary as the pockets are deep enough, but its a nice touch.  I find the fit to be nearly perfect for me.  I generally wear 34 x 32 pants and the Large fits like 35 x 33 maybe.  It's a bit long, but not by a lot.  Maybe I could have gotten a Medium, but I'd rather my sweats be on the larger side.

        "First of all to the sizing as many have asked about the Carhartt Men's Force Midweight Tech Thermal Base Layer Pants. I am 130 lbs and 5' 5\" and ordered a Medium. The waist fits perfectly, but what I was taken aback by was the legs of the pants themselves. When I first put them on I had a flashback of the 80s parachute pants as they are a bit baggy in the legs overall. Unlike traditional thermal underwear which clings to your skin from waist to ankle, these have a looser fit in the legs. They are designed to be moisture wicking so it makes sense to me for the looseness, also they are silky soft on the skin as they are 100% polyester. Hope this helps, stay warm!",
        "These thermals have been serving me great through these snow storms at work, they work so well that when I\u2019m on the store floor i can get a bit sweaty lol.Pros:-Great price-Comfortable material-Trustworthy work clothing brand-Holds up in the cold (worn multiple times in 10 degrees Fahrenheit and below)-Fits to your body wellCons:-Tends to roll up your legs when putting on second layer! Tuck the bottoms into your socks!-Not enough cons!",
        "Well made and much warmth! The fit was perfect and the thickness felt amazing.",
        "Great quality!  These are excellent quality that feel great and look great. The only negative is they are loose at the bottom but, not snug at the bottom like most thermal underwear but because of the quality it doesn't bother me. I just tuck them into my socks before pulling them up. LOVE THESE!! I bought another pair plus two of the matching tops. I am good now for the season!!!",
        "This is just what I expected and a very good fit.",
        "This was an excellent upgrade from my old waffle material thermals. Very warm. When paired with lined pants there wasn't even a thought of insulated boobs when outside in freezing temps for longer periods of time. Will be buying more!",

Build quality is good and I\u2019m not totally disappointed, but these will be reserved for use on non windy days wind cuts right thru them. Will have to investigate their full/heavy weight option in the future.",

        "The Fruit of the Loom Men's Boxer Briefs have become my go-to choice for underwear, and for good reason. The comfort level of these boxer briefs is unmatched, thanks to the soft, breathable cotton fabric that feels great against the skin. The fit is just right, offering ample support without being too tight, and the longer length prevents chafing. The waistband doesn't dig in, providing an all-day comfortable wear. I appreciate the durability of these boxer briefs \u2013 they withstand regular washing without losing their shape or color. The variety of colors and patterns in each pack adds a touch of fun to my underwear drawer. Whether for daily wear or workouts, these boxer briefs deliver on both comfort and functionality. Overall, Fruit of the Loom Men's Boxer Briefs offer a fantastic combination of comfort, durability, and style at an affordable price, making them an excellent choice for any man's wardrobe.",
        "Removed from packaging same day they arrived. Washed a couple of days later. All our clothes are washed in cold water, dried in a low heat dryer. Shrank at least a size. Do not hold their shape. Tried wearing 1 pair, couldn't get through a day of wear.",
        "Good fit in the am but a bit lacking by afternoon.  Will tend too bunch up in the tender bits region.  Leg opening kind of stretch out allowing for ride up.  But they feel good in the morning.",
        "I do like that these work for a larger man and the big man sizes great if a man has bigger thighs, or if he\u2019s not an Abercrombie model and a real man size with a real man waste their breathable there comfortable around the thighs per my husband they\u2019re great underwear they\u2019re breathable they\u2019re fashionable they\u2019re nice they come in great colors they\u2019re comfortable But definitely overpriced. I just don\u2019t understand why the prices so much probably because they know they can charge so much what we really need is a more reasonable and wear in socks for men instead of them being overpriced but yes, I would suggest purchasing these, if you have a  Need for great underwear plus if you buy the big man size like myself, for example, like my husband who is a police officer who has very large arms and legs, but in this situation, we\u2019re talking about his thighs because he works out and he\u2019s  a large muscular person. And again you don\u2019t have to be muscular you can be overweight but regardless if you have big legs, the big man size of this brand is the way to go. I purchased three XL the first time but they were just way too large so I ordered two XL this time and it works great so they\u2019re definitely true to the size.",
        "This is the third time I have bought these for my husband. He loves them because they are slightly snug but still breathable. The sizing guide was spot on. He does a ton of walking at work so they do eventually get holes around the crotch region but it takes him about a year to wear out a pack of twelve. A great buy for the price.",
        "Last minute order for my teenage son , it fits great and arrived right on time for our trip. Will definitely buy again and recommend.",
        "To be honest these are expensive, but they are definitely one of best boxer briefs I have.They are comfortable and fit snug on your waist and private area. I don\u2019t feel the need to stretch it out later in the day so I know they fit well. They are a good length, not short like others I have bought before.They wash fine as far as I can tell and haven\u2019t stained either.

        "I bought a dozen pairs over a year ago.  No holes, tears, wearing, etc...  I work in a foundry and wear steel toed boots and walk around on concrete daily.  I also wear these with my regular Ariat boots.  I have tried many other socks, these have held up the best, hands down.",
        "Bought these for the other adult to wear with his steel toe boots. These specialty socks can be difficult to find locally. It is hit and miss whether they are in stock so it is easier to order them here. This is a quality brand and the extra thickness in the toe box and heel area works well and the mostly cotton socks help prevent excessively hot and sweaty feet.And although the band at the sock opening has rather stiff elastic, they did not dig into his average-size calves or leave a mark. But I can see that with large legs the band may be unyielding to the point of discomfort. He wears a size 10 shoe and the fit for the 10-13 sock is true. They are machine washable so require no special treatment. Very comfortable and will definitely buy again.",
        "Cushy, extremely durable and great fit! This is the third time purchased over  the past 5 years! If everything we bought was as long lasting!",
        "These are great socks. Warm and well made but if you wear a size 11, order the smaller size because the heel of my socks I just received are up on the back of my ankle. They went up way past the heel of my foot. It\u2019s not a big deal because the socks are great but are big!",
        "Feel great, thinner than what I was used to but not an issue.  So far they are wearing well.",
        "Best socks for work boots!!",
        "I ordered him these socks before, but in two different sizes.  After a complete testing, size large it is.  They were both this same sock, however, and they are a good product.  They launder well, wear well and don't stretch out.  The XL were just a little too large.  At $7.50 a sock once you shake out the price with tax for everyday socks:  sorta pricey, but they meet his sock needs to the letter.  Recommended.  :)",
        "Here is the issue.... The foot part of the sock is great. It is nice, thick, and cushioned. The issue is the upper part of the sock. It is narrow, thin, and not very stretchy. I have to stretch it to just get my size 10 foot in. I can see it already getting stretched out to just get my average sized foot it. If it was thicker up top and more resilient to stretching it would be great. I would not buy again.",
        "I love these socks. I go through socks very quickly as I have one foot a half size bigger than the other but the extra thickness that these have at the heel and toe means they are more resilient to wearing when it's from the foot as well as from the footwear.One slight downside is the fit around the calf is tight and a thin band and I'd prefer that to be a wider band so the pressure is spread over a wider area.These are the best work socks for me by far that I've found and worth the price.",
        "Medida y calidad excelente. Gruesas para botas de trabajo.",
        "Very well cushioned for long days on your feet in steel toe work boots. Warm for cold environments. They stay up and don't slouch into boots after hours of wear. Well worth the money. Wash well and held up longer than any other work socks I've purchased. After 7 months most of our work socks are full of holes. These still feel brand new.",
        "We bought these socks for my husband 1-2 years ago and he is still wearing some of them...they were excellent socks in every area.  They are the only socks he wears.  Just got 4 new pair and they are almost knee high !  He is going to keep them but I think Amazon should check more closely when they get new stock in to see that it is in fact the same as what they have been advertising.",
        "Long and very snug sock that has more than enough padding to take the edge off of wearing steel toe boots all day. It won't save your feet by themselves but it's definitely something you want to buy a couple packs of. I wear above ankle socks and these over top of them."

        "Whats most important to know about ordering these is that selecting a different color selects a different style and therefore a totally different garment. The red union suit has buttons and a slit in the back, is made with heavyweight cotton, and has close fitting cuffs and ankles. The black union suits are made of lightweight, waffle type cotton and polyester, (like the older style two piece thermal underwear),  have snap button closures, do not fit snugly around the cuffs or ankles like the red style, and in the back have a separation of the union suit with an elastic band that allows you to tuck in the upper piece. More on this below.The red, heavier weight cotton version I find to be extremely comfortable, very warm in cold weather, and overall more comfortable than the black style. The ankle and cuff closure are thick and elastic and make putting on clothes less aggravating as they hold the sleeves and legs from riding up as you are getting dressed.They are more suited for colder weather than the black style and DO have a flap in the back for those who would use it. They wick moisture away and I find them to be the most comfortable of the two styles.The black style is more suited for milder cold weather. I like the snap style buttons better on these but thats where it ends. As one reviewer stated about the buttons on the other style, they sometimes are not the right size and need to either be replaced or have someone sew up the button hole as they come unbuttoned. But most annoying of the black style is the rear separation of the upper and lower with the elastic band. (Look at the pictures provided by Amazon) It is like it is a one piece in the front and a two piece in the back. Plus it is impossible to use the bathroom without taking them off on the top and that makes them inconvenient. I find that if it is anything below freezing they are too lightweight and if it is above 50 F they feel uncomfortable as they don\u2019t wick moisture away as easily.Carhartt is known for durable, long lasting clothing and the red style is in line with their usual quality. I bought the red style first and love them. I mistakenly bought the black style thinking they were just like the red style and I never wear them unless it is mild or my red ones are dirty. I DO wish the red style had the snap closure, but beyond that I love them. Look at the pictures provided by Amazon carefully and you will see the difference in the two styles. It is misleading to most and  I wasted my money on the black style.",

        "I originally bought this to put on and make my wife laugh. Little did i know. I would fall in love with it. Super comfy to work in. It has kept me warm through the winter months. Great price for the value! Fit exactly as it should",
        "This is a good union suit for the price. I am 6'2\" and weigh around 275, so I ordered the XXL size. Since I am long through the torso, it seems like when I pull it on over my shoulder that the overall length of it is a bit lacking for my torso length. If you tend to be more \"leggy\" or under 6 feet tall, it will probably be proportioned better for you.There is a problem with the buttons wanting to come loose within the first or second wearing. I've had to have my wife sew 3 of them back on already and a 4th one is now coming loose. With so many buttons on a union suit, it's a shame that these are coming loose so soon. It is an industry wide problem with buttons coming loose on garments, but this is way too fast. I am waiting for the day when the garment industry finds a way to better secure buttons on all garments. Who wants to spend time sewing them back on simply because they were not well attached in the first place.That matter aside, this is a good union suit that will keep you warm and comfy. Just watch out for any buttons coming loose and sew them on more securely or you'll lose them.",
        "My husband asked for these because his old base layer just wasnt working very well.  These are perfect!",
        "I've barely had these a month and already have buttons falling off. If these were $20 I'd be disappointed, but for over $60 it is unacceptable. Why pay extra for Carhartt if this is the quality?",
        "Carhartt quality, very well made, will not disappoint!!advise to get a size larger than normal",
        "They fit well allow him to work and keepHim warm",
        "Love this!! Very warm!!",
        "i wore these deer hunting they were a life saver, anyone who has been at hunt camp knows these would be well worn, they washed and dried very well and continue to look and wear as good as day one",
        "Came on time, excellent material, good quality perfect gift thankyou indo reccomend",
        "Used for base layer on cold hunting daysThe \u201crear hatch\u201d isn\u2019t all that practical when wearing bibs over topThose who know will know lol",
        "All in the rate 4/5 their good for mild cold weather I\u2019d say up to -12 max but make sure you put on 1 or more shirts on after or they don\u2019t work, the sweat wicking actually works you\u2019ll sweat and it\u2019ll be wet for 5 mins then it will be gone and no smell 4/5"

I ordered 7 pairs, 4 needed to be returned.  The stitching around the leg came undone. 1 before the first wash, the rest after wearing.  I'm not sure if the thread broke or if it was never stitched right....  Exofficio ignored my email request for a warranty claim (presently going on almost two weeks).  Thanks to amazon for taking the return for the defective items.  I like them, but honestly at a MSRP of nearly 30 bucks, this shouldn't be happening.",
        "New favorite underwear!  I do wish they were just an inch or two longer, but they\u2019re so good that they\u2019re still instant new favorites.  Plus the design just says hidden awesomeness all day.",

        "Kept reading reviews on the build quality of these. But the ones I got were perfectly fine. They feel great and the material and build is good. I had the original ones too and they outlasted all my other pairs. Hope these last just as long. Recommend for sure.",
        "Bought for backpacking, got very stinky on first day, washed and aired out overnight and stank even worse after second day. Never had a problem like this with merino.  Did not see any difference in these and Hanes mesh except the cost per pair.  I bought 2 pair on the hype surrounding them, definitely not worthy of the price.  Merino may take longer to dry, but at least you get what you pay for.  The only pro I could find is comfort, but I can buy 8 pairs of Hanes mesh for 1 pair of these and there is little discernable difference in comfort.  Very disappointed.",

        "One of the other guardians on Honor Flight had one of these for our last Honor Flight. It always seems to pour the rain in DC in the fall. I usually buy the disposable raincoats but seen Ralph with this and thought it was amazing! bout me three! one for myself and two for my veterans. Keeps you dry AND warm! very comfortable and well made, doesn't stick to your body when wet and doesn't tear like the paper thin disposables. folds up nicely. highly recommend for travel. I was amazed at how warm it kept me in the freezing rain.",
        "My wife and I purchased these ponchos to wear when walking our dog in the rain. They are amazing in repelling water and while we thought they were a little long initially, turns out the longer length simply helps keep more of our legs drier when it's really pouring down. They are super lightweight and easy to fold/roll up to store in the supplied pouches. We keep them in our car all the time just in case since they could easily replace our umbrellas if needed.We are planning on purchasing more of them to give as gifts to our other dog walking friends since they are also crazy enough to go out when its storming.......",
        "I have mixed feelings about this poncho. There's pros and cons, and it truly depends on who is purchasing this poncho and what for! I purchased this poncho for our Disney Trip. I have heard great things about Frogg Toggs, including the long life and great coverage, so I figured this purchase would be perfect for all the Disney Trips we take throughout the years! And if I liked it, then I would purchase another for my husband.I received it 2 days before our trip. Thankful I opened it because the smell of a burnt forest is not what I'd be able to walk around smelling like throughout my trip. The smell was HORRIFIC! Not sure why or how it gets this smell, but it is definitely not even close to being wearable unless it is washed first. When I opened it up completely, there was a tear in the front of it. It was small, but it was mixing that whole waterproofed layer of material, and no doubt if we were in heavy rain, it would go through. I contacted the company immediately, and they sent out a new one overnight!!! VERY PLEASED with the Customer Service! With that being said, I did have to wait till it arrived in order to wash it because of the smell. But it arrived, I put it in a laundry bag for protection, added it with a few other items and washed it on gentle cycle. It came out great, stink free, put it in the dryer for 2 minutes to get the excess water off before I hung it to dry, and it was dry to take on my trip the next morning.Now.. onto the size and coverage. This thing is HUGE! I am 5' 3, and although I wish I can say I was super skinny, I can't :-(. But... I'm not really big either. I wore maybe a size 8 at that time. Comes down really low. Hey.. Can't complain about the coverage now, right? It's not to the point of it tripping me, but it is extremely long! Not a biggy.. It's light weight, does not feel bulky and heavy, and I'll get great coverage obviously. I also wanted this one because of the hood. I can tighten it so it doesn't fly off when it's really windy. But the hood ended up being a problem. It was SO BIG, that it not only covered my whole head, but my entire face too!!! Not even an exaggeration! I tried to stop it at my forehead and tighten the toggle to keep it from going over my face, but it didn't work. So it is very hard to walk around the parks in this, as I can't see where I'm going! I wore it on splash mountain, and we had the best laugh at the action shot of the log flume going down. Who is that faceless person?!?!? All you saw next to my little 5 year old, was a giant blue cape! It really was funny!So... I gave it 4 because it does have great coverage and the durability is obvious. Will last for many years to come. But, it has been passed over to my husband because the hood is just way too big. For him as well, But he can deal with it better. And as far as the smell is concerned.. easy fix by washing it gently in a netted garment/washer bag if you don't have front loads, to prevent it from getting torn in the wash. Just make sure you order it to arrive several days before you will need it and you'll be fine.Overall... This poncho is of great quality and will have a very long life if you take care of it and store it properly. Perfect for a man or tall woman. And the hood? Not too horrific if you're not as picky as me or have an issue if it flies off your head.",
        "We are going to Disney next month and were looking for compact reusable ponchos just in case it rains. These are perfect being light, durable, and affordable to pack with us.",
        "This is a very nice, thick and durable raincoat.  Worked great at Volcano National Park when it was 55 and super windy with light rain.",
        "Took this with me on vacation and it rained pretty good for 2 hours a day while I was walking around.  The poncho covered myself and my backpack, it comes in a waterproof pouch that made traveling home with a partially wet poncho easier.  In a hotel room the poncho did dry out overnight but I had a very very early morning flight so it didn\u2019t have an opportunity to dry.",
        "I recently purchased the Frogg Toggs Ultra-Lite2 Poncho.Pros:Striking Color: The first thing that caught my eye was the color. It's vibrant and stands out, which is great for visibility during outdoor activities.Effectiveness: Yes, it works! I've been out in the rain a few times with it, and it's kept me dry. The waterproofing does its job well, which is the most important aspect of rain gear.Cons:Material Quality: While the material is fine and seems breathable, it feels a bit flimsy. I'm a bit concerned about its durability in the long run, especially if it gets caught on something sharp.Overall Build: The overall build quality reflects the ultra-light nature of the product. It's great for light rain and moderate conditions but might not hold up in more extreme weather or rough usage.Conclusion:Overall, the Frogg Toggs Ultra-Lite2 Poncho is a decent choice for someone who needs basic rain protection without the bulk. It's wonderfully lightweight and easy to pack, making it ideal for light outdoor activities or as an emergency rain gear. However, if you're looking for something to withstand rough conditions or more rigorous use, you might want to consider something more robust. It's a good balance of functionality and style, just handle it with care!",
        "I am 5'6, 220 lbs, and bought this poncho for my own use on rainy day hikes in Georgia, USA.  I wanted breathability so I don't overheat.  This poncho is perfectly waterproof and very roomy and comfortable.  The snap closures allow air flow.  My only dislike is that the length is knee length (on me) front and back, meaning that wearing even a small backpack causes the back to ride up too high for me to be able to sit and keep my seat area dry.  I still like this poncho so much that I bought a second one to have a spare.  Great for hiking on a rainy day trail!",
        "It really is a quality poncho.  It does take up a bit of space in the backpack, but it's light and performs very well at keeping you dry.  And its coverage is excellent also.  So glad I considered the many great reviews!",
        "I waited for a big store and walked for 1 hour. No sweat and completly dry",

        "Over the years I have tried Copper Compression socks and while they aren't bad compression socks they don't hold up if you wear them while working. I've tried Dickie's compression socks. Those hold up well in a work environment but the way they compress your leg is weird. Some compression on the foot, next to none on the ankle and calf then high compression near the top. Makes them uncomfortable if you wear them for a long time because the top part cuts into your leg. I've tried no name brand from LIVSOX store, those felt like plastic bags. I've tried Amazon Brand Solimo socks. WAY to thin to last even as dress socks. And I've tried Futuro compression socks. These are good dress socks. They look nice and are fairly comfortable. But don't try to work in them. Nor are they comfortable for around the house. Finally I have tried these socks.The Thorlos over calf compression socks are darn near perfect. I have had these for almost 2 months now. I work in them, I slouch around the house in then, they have been through 6+ wash cycles. No sign of wear. And boy are these comfortable! It's like wearing knit socks your Grammy made without the itch when you sweat. The compression is perfectly scaled. Nice amount on the feet. Not to much not to little. Good amount on the ankle and shins and the calf and the end cuff is nice and gentle. Does not cut into your leg even after a 14 hour shift.I really can not say enough positive things about these socks. If you need compression socks for home or work, GET THESE!",
        "I didn't think I would ever purchase $20 socks but sure glad I did. I work at a steel mine. I'm on my feet for 12 hour days in the crappiest places you could imagine. Most of that is walking on concrete or steel floor grating. It's a pretty big deal to find the best and comfiest work boots you can wear. I recently purchased Wolverine Durashock boots but for some reason my boots kept pulling my socks down. I was constantly stopping every few minutes to pull my socks back up. It was driving me crazy! I went to a local sporting goods store and bought a pair of \"Darn Tough\" socks that are made in Vermont. They were pretty high end socks but I was desperate to find socks that would not fall down in my boot. Needless to say they to fell off my calf and down to my ankles. I started doing some sock research and found the Thorlos. After reading some of the reviews I decided to purchase one pair to see if they would work for me. Again, I'm on my feet for most of the day walking on concrete and steel grating. These Thorlos socks preformed so well. I never once had to stop during the day to pull up my socks. They were snug but so comfortable to wear. Usually with other socks I wore in the past my socks were wet at the end of the day. Not so with the Thorlos socks. My feet were dry. I was so impressed that I brought my newly wore socks home to wash so I could wear them the next day. I ended up buying 3 more pair so I could have 4 pairs for my 4 day work set. I like the fact that they are made in the USA and warrantied for life!  You can't go wrong with that! I wear a size 10 boot and bought large socks. They're a perfect fit! I'll be buying more of these Thorlos 12 hr shift work socks.",
        "These socks are super comfortable. I work a 12hr shift, couple days on, couple days off sort of deal. The 12 hours always turns into 13,14\u2026or more.The socks truly make your feet and calves feel great. I had knee replacement last August and still get some stiffness and soreness in my calf. Tried these and live them.I am a big dude, an old college O-lineman from the late 80\u2019s. 6\u20194, 260. I am pretty fit and have big legs. Calves are around 19\u201d diameter.The XL size fit great. Give you a nice squeeze but not too much. I could use a bit more in length but they land about 2\u201d below my knee cap. I think that\u2019s because I wear a 14 shoe. Size 12 feet, will no doubt fit better.I seriously wish I had these 20 years ago.Since getting this pair, I\u2019ve bought 3 more.They are worth it..!!",
        "I like that these are made in the USA but the first critique of the sock was that they are very tight in the calves. My husband does not have large calves. Also, the soles are very thick. Which is specified in the description. Will be ok for winter use and seem to be durable.",
        "Very comfortable and durable socks.  Lots of support and fit my size 15 feet very good --which is hard to find socks that fit.  My feet do not hurt as much after standing all day.  Will buy more in the future.",
        "These are very well made comfortable socks. I was so happy I ordered two more pairs before washing the first pair. Much to my surprise they shrunk on Permanent Press dryer setting. They no longer fit so I am returning the unworn second pair.",
        "$20 for a pair of socks is a lot of money, but these are well padded and have some decent compression on them. Glad I bought them.",
        "I,ve used Thorlos for years. Cormfortable and really durable. I need a little more support now and these provide it with Thorlo quality. They cost a little more but value beats price."

        "What can ya say, they fit and are comfortable",
        "The fit is as advertised, and very comfortable, I use the Underarmour under my workout clothes during lifting and treadmill exercises. The fit is very good. love the colors, black and red",
        "So comfortable and durable for the bigger athletic guys in life",
        "the person I bought these for loves them",
        "Very few companies seem to care about the larger guys out here, but these are great.  Only gave 4 starts because of the price.  I started out with one test pair and liked them.  Got a 2 pack and same.... I had been wearing the BCG's but they stopped at 2X.  Unfortunately I went up a size in the past 6 months and there are hardly any quality options out there for over 2X.  The ones I got are 3X and are great.  The boxer brief style and material is great for those of us that have issues with chaffing / sores to being overweight.  Great Product!",
        "Alright, this is very straightforward.Reason for purchase:Looking for a durabe undergarment that can comfortably be worn all-day, everyday, but also easily transition to intense workout without discomfort, chaffing, or ridiculous ride-up.Fit:  Completely True to sizeFeel:  Perfect cut, NEVER stretch out. (If you've ever worn FotL, or Hanes cotton, you are familiar with putting on boxer-briefs, and having them become loose fit boxers inside an hour. Not with these.)Quality:  The tags are a HUGE pain, BUT designed to be removable. They are stitched in after the seam is stitched, so even if you damage a couple threads, your seem wont start falling apart. With some patience, they come out completely. (Okay, maybe a good deal of patience, but it's a non-issue with the quality.)Durability:  I have had mine for six months and even with my tendency to destroy everything with regular use, I still see no signs of wear.Overall:  If you want to buy new underwear, and you would like to buy the last underwear you will ever need - buy these. Don't bother with the off-brands, the Adidas or Nike versions. Stay away from copycats. Even if you only buy two pair a month, suck it up and do it. I promise, after a month of wear, you will consider the price one of the best investments you've ever made.On a side note, this is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review. Ever. For anything. And I am writing it while finishing an order for MORE of these. Because the first ten pair weren't enough. I'll never buy another kind/brand/style of underwear. May these never change. (If it isn't broke...)",
        "I have switched all my underwear to Under Armour and my socks.  They are great quality and have lasted a long time.",
        "I have owned them for 15 months now and they are my go to's for work.They move moisture, stay tight, and keep you in place. I sweat gallons so its hard for me to notice how well they breathe and they breathe well because I can still keep working with acceptable comfort. For context I work in construction, so im always in uncomfortable situation. They are a little to snug for casual activity, but that is a preferrence thing.Definently buying more so i have more than 2 pairs of underwear for the 6 day work week. Yeah i wash them every other day.",

        "I have seen some bad reviews on these pants here, but after buying one pair and feeling just how comfortable they are, I knew that I had to get at least one more pair of them.  One small annoyance that didn't affect the rating for me was the fact that the pockets have velcro enclosures and the soft velcro portion disfigured within a few washes therefore making any sort of security for the cargo pockets rather ineffective.  That doesn't bother me one bit, however.  Also, the cell phone pocket size has been updated from the previous versions to accommodate the current big cell phone sizes in their protective cases.  I have a very old phone by today's standards, a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 in an OtterBox and it fits perfectly in the cell phone sleeve of the pants.  I have no issues with the zipper as some other have, and the size is very comfortable as well.  I'll be ordering more of these pants in different colors shortly!",
        "I had almost given up on Wrangler cargos. I've been wearing Wrangler cargos for years. Over the last few years I had been underwhelmed by their quality and fit. However, these new comfort stretch are phenomenal! They've restored my faith! Super light weight and comfortable. They give a wonderfully airy feel. I love the feel of the material! I use them for work. They're very durable, so far. The first pair was so nice, I bought 2 more!",

        "I have worn these pants for a few years as work attire. These pants have become an absolute staple in my wardrobe, and here's why.Firstly, the comfort level is unparalleled. The fabric used is not only soft to the touch but also provides an excellent level of stretch, allowing for ease of movement without compromising on style. Whether I'm sitting at my desk, running errands, or enjoying a casual outing, these khaki pants offer a level of comfort that makes them suitable for any occasion.The quality of craftsmanship is evident from the moment you put them on. These khakis have proven to withstand the test of time and maintain their shape and color through numerous washes.The fit is another aspect that deserves praise. The designers seem to have struck the perfect balance between a tailored look and relaxed feel. The pants sit comfortably at the waist, and the cut is flattering without being too tight or too loose. The versatility of the design allows for easy pairing with both casual and more polished ensembles.I am typically a 36\u00d734 size, but the 34\u00d734 in these pants fit me best.In conclusion, if you're in the market for khaki pants that deliver on both comfort and quality, look no further. These pants have become my go-to choice, and I recommend them to anyone seeking a versatile, well-crafted wardrobe essential.",
        "Great comfort. Look good for work or casual wear.  small amount of spandex make them great for work when you are on the move. Not so much spandex in the material they feel flimsy.",
        "First off, I like these pants. I've bought 25 of them since Feb 2019. They are comfortable, look great, and you name it, I've done it in these pants. That being said, there are a few drawbacks. Since about 2022 there has been right pocket issues where a hole develops and the bottom corner. Typically what I will do is as soon as a new pants order arrives, is to take them out and resew the front pockets. It looks like the machine stitch is too close to the material edge which causes the hole. Luckily, a few minutes on the sewing machine and that problem is permanently solved. Next, the pants are extremely durable. I wear them everyday; to my job, mowing the grass, working on the mower, doing renovation, these pants rarely cut or develop puncture holes. They aren't specifically made for it, but handle it quite well. Sometimes I'll get grass, grease or oil on them and within 3 washes I can get them business casual again. These pants will have 2 failure points. The first is the zipper. About 20-30% of the pants will develop a busted zipper within a few months of use. Once that happens throw them out because it costs more for a tailor to replace the zipper than the pants are worth. The second failure mode occurs right around a year where the material in the crotch region thins out to the point that holes or large rips occur. This happens 100% of the time. This usually leads to funny stories especially if you are out in public when this happens. Personally I don't mind these problems because the pants perform well and look great.",
        "I use these pants for work.I have a nonoffice job and I on and off my seat throughout the day.Best feature of these pants is the stretchy material which is intended for comfort. These are not yoga type pants and they fit just right with enough leg room to appear straight yet not tight.Also, the front pockets are deep enough for my phone disallowing the phone from popping out of my pocket during seating or upon getting out of my seat.  I have the iPhone 14 Pro and it fits entirely therein.These are easy to wash and I happen to iron all my clothes.  These pants are plain front but I still iron them with a crease down the middle front of the leg but I can iron them completely flat front too and they still look great.Belt area allows for my 2\" belt to sit nicely in the belt area.Have received compliments on these pants from the girls at work. ;)Highly recommend these pants. Will buy again.",
        "This is the third pair of pants I have purchased from this brand.They are very comfortable, and the color remains after a year and a half of washing them every three days of use.The adjustable waist is ideal when you feel bloated, I normally go from size 34 to 36 but with these I no longer have that problem.The fabric is very comfortable, the length is just right to cover the tops of shoes, and it is formal enough to wear in an office setting.Very satisfied with the purchase, I will probably buy more in different colors.",
        "Very comfortable pants that move with you and do not pinch around the waist! stylish and well made.",
        "These are very comfortable and the crotch area is correct looking no baggy shit. Looks proper and this purchase I am happy with. I originally purchased 3 blue and 3 black. I ran those thin and knee holes in 1 year rotating the uniform pants being a plumber/ electrician & a/c tech. Work 6 days a week and revolved them thru a year. I tried 6 pair of another brand that I like better. I ordered 2 more of these because they fit well and I work better in comfortable pants. I\u2019m certain you\u2019ll like this style and never mind the brand lee Wh itch is kinda Walmart k-mart brand. I don\u2019t feel cheesy in these even though the brand is lee. Like wrangle brand is cheaper price but lee fit in crotch properly where wrangle brand messes that up. Satisfied with this purchase I am.",
        "First and foremost, the Total Freedom Stretch technology lives up to its name. The flexibility and ease of movement these pants provide are unparalleled. Whether I'm sitting at my desk or on the move, the stretch fabric ensures maximum comfort without sacrificing the slim fit silhouette. It's like wearing pants that are tailor-made for my every move.The slim fit design is both modern and flattering. These pants strike the perfect balance between a contemporary aesthetic and classic style, making them suitable for various occasions. Whether I'm dressing up for a business meeting or going for a casual look, these pants effortlessly adapt to any setting.Durability is a key factor that sets these pants apart. After multiple wears and washes, they still look as good as new. The high-quality construction and attention to detail in stitching contribute to their long-lasting appeal. I appreciate that I can rely on these pants to maintain their shape and color over time.The flat front design adds a polished and sophisticated touch to the overall look. It's a versatile style that pairs well with a range of shirts and shoes, allowing for endless outfit possibilities. The variety of color options available ensures that there's a perfect pair for every occasion and personal style.Lastly, the affordability of these pants is remarkable. For the level of quality and versatility they offer, the price point is more than reasonable. It's refreshing to find a pair of pants that not only meets but exceeds expectations without breaking the bank.",

The fabric is smooth, soft and comfortable and the cotton polyester blend should hold up much better than my all cotton ones have.  I like the not only the texture of the fabric but the weight of it too.",
        "Great fit and good quality.",
        "NOTE: Rarely give 5 full stars. That requires absolute perfection.This item (purchased on sale, as an experiment) is a great LS T-shirt. It launders well, has a good deep colour (unlike photo in ad, this is a true navy).  Because it is a blend (60/40 IIRC) it dries quickly, is somewhat lighter in weight, and holds the colour better for folks who perhaps use higher temps. I use cold water with minimal drying for regular cycles, and hang to finish drying-- but ran this through warm and full drying cycle to see how it would wear and [potentially] shrink.This is comfortable as a layering piece, a sleeping shirt, or just on its own. This is *not* a \"beefy\" weight of T-shirt, so usually have it as another layer over a SS T-shirt and under a mid-weight fleece or hoodie for outdoors up to 45F. More layers required after that. Went and bought it in three other colours after this initial purchase, and will get more at next Amazon Prime sale or similar, as these are the kinds of things that get worn out at home.NOTE: This is a blend, so if you wear this exposed directly to a ruck sack/ backpack, it will pill from the rubbing. Same true also for other harnesses, my bullet proof vest, and similar things that may rub over distances or frequency of use.",

They are not snug nor baggy, just skim my body like I wanted. The v-neck is not too deep, it\u2019s flattering but modest. They shrunk a little after a cold wash/medium tumble dry. If you are very well groomed you may want to iron them as the hem turns up a bit after washing and they look slightly rumpled (I don\u2019t mind at all.) Comfortable enough for sleep and, exercise but look great with just about any outfit. Not heavy but not thin.",

Made from soft, yet durable cotton, these shirts are comfortable to wear, whether as an undershirt or on their own.The V-neck design is versatile and fits well under different types of shirts without showing. They hold up well even after multiple washes, retaining their shape and comfort. Ideal for anyone looking for reliable, no-fuss basics that feel great and last long.",

        "So it was time for some new undershirts.  Having previously used Haines and Fruit of the Loom - I can testify that both brands usually shrink and end up too short to stay tucked in throughout the day.  For the price - and because I could get talls - I ordered these.  They seem thicker than normal shirts.  And as for the size, they fit great - except they are just a little longer than expected.  I'm 5'11\" and these are as long as any of my dress shirts and maybe longer.  Even if they shrink some, they are long enough that there is no chance they are coming untucked.",

        "Just received this jacket and first impression is very good. Medium - Fits well if a tad snug. The feel of the jacket is smooth and soft. The color, red, is not a bright red, so fits my color tastes perfectly. Zippers are very smooth up and down. I like that it zips all the way up into a high collar, keeping the neck area warm in cold/cool air. Inside pockets on both sides, nice. Stepped outside for a minute on this cool not cold day and it feels quite warm. Will see over time how warm it is in colder weather. I do have a heavier Hilfiger jacket for very cold weather so this was bought for cool to cooler weather. Obviously have not worn it in the rain, but then I do not spend a lot of time in the rain, so it is not of much concern to me. I'm sure it will do fine for running to and from the car. Noticed one commenter complained it is cheap and thin. I'd ask what do you not understand about the description that say's it is a lightweight jacket. Still it does not strike me as cheap (very reasonably priced) and of good quality. If my experience changes I'll be back to update, but for now I am very satisfied with this jacket and am thinking of getting another with the ICE color and maybe a step up in size. Though I do like a slim look as compared to big and bulky, so maybe not. ;-)",

Two nice-sized inside pockets for phone and other items, zippered exterior pockets, and adjustable drawstring at inside of waist to make it as snug as you like. Good quality, fit, and features. Would buy again.",
        "First - I do not write reviews ordinarily. This item however rates a shining review as it is uncommonly satisfying.  I like everything about this jacket. The fit is perfect. The styling is obvious and on point. Little highlights like the discreet color accents , rubber zipper pulls, and Hilfiger logo patch on sleeve , along with a contrasting gold lining mark it as not just another \"camo jacket\". You can wear this one anywhere and not feel like you are a lost deerhunter.Its camo at haute couture level. Kudos to Hilfiger !A great value especially at the price its being sold.",
        "Pro: I really like the look of the jacket. The material is soft and it feels awesome. Quite warm.Con: Unfortunately the size small I got fits like most other medium sized jackets I've tried on.",
        "The used quality of TH, light, warm and good looking. Bought two, for my son and I",
        "Nice jacket!",
        "I love that you can squish it down in your carry on or use it as your travel pillow and then pull it out as needed. Comes with its own little bag. Perfection.",
        "I love how I look in this jacket. The fit is perfect, feather light yet just the right amount of warmth for a walk around downtown. The colour is great and has the feel of silk.",
        "Muy c\u00f3moda y bonitaLa marca. Tommy es de c\u00e1lidaLigera y muy  abrigadaLa Talla m me quedo bien ya que es la talla que uso generalmenteNi apretada ni grande ala medidaMuy bien el corte y dise\u00f1oLleg\u00f3 r\u00e1pido sin ning\u00fan problemaRecomiendo",

        "If you are looking a light weight and warm jacket you are in the right place. I really love this jacket. Fit in size, is super light, not as many other options of TNF, marmot, and Columbia too. The only thing that I\u2019m disappointed with this jacket is the closures on each side. I don\u2019t understand why the designer put this terrible closures (look at 2nd Pic). But it still looks great because isn\u2019t visible to the eye. 4 of 5 stars for this product that was delivered before the estimate delivery",
        "Baltimore winters get a little colder than I expected and I didn't have a coat. I ordered this simply because it was the only black Columbia coat with a hood that I could find. I had been wearing it for a while, and I found that it was super warm. But when it got a little windy I went to tighten the hood. When I did, I noticed that the hood itself wasn't moving, but it was getting tighter around my face area. It was another piece of fabric attached to it that was literally constricting around my head. It's like a built-in hat when you need one, as well as just a hood when you don't. Best coat I've over owned.",
        "very good jacket with quality material. for average temperature",
        "Better than I expected, very light and comfortable jacket (just like your fav sweatshirt). Good for NYC winter weather.",
        "I put off this purchase until I could find the product in a store (Dick's) and try it on to get a feel for size and for what kind of winter weather it would address. I'd suggest something on the lines of a scoring system for these coats to separate the \"winter in Kansas\" coats from the \"winter in Western Canada\" coats. It would probably drive on line sales if I could reliably predict that this coat is good to X degrees and the other model is good to Y degrees.....Great product, a reliable brand (I went looking) and I'm 100% satisfied with the end result - I just wish it had been easier to evaluate these on line.",
        "Muy resistente a la lluvia y a temperaturas bajas",
        "I didn't want a thick winter jacket. This coat is surprisingly very thin but still keeps me warm. I usually wear medium and I can still layer a sweatshirt underneath it. I often get too hot in my heavier Columbia coat but I don't in this one. The only negative thing I can say is that the hood doesn't detach nor roll up into the collar.",
        "Pros : Warm, comfy, dry, and extremely lightweight!Cons : The arms could be more padded and warmer. I wish it had a bottom zipper that opens up when you sit down. As is, I have to lift it. This may have to do with the fit on my specific body : I am large and short. So the coat is a little long on my arms. I am unaware of how it could be tailored, especially if you wish to conserve the velcro sleeves. However, this is a me issue : If you are taller than me / less chubby, it will fit great I think.For this price, it is definitely worth it.",

        "This collection of dress socks will match any outfit. They are very soft and hold their shape well after washing. I was expecting them to be thicker like other Goldtoe socks I have purchased, but they are thinner like a traditional dress sock.",
        "These are good quality and fit really well. I wear 13 shoes, so Sock shopping is difficult.  Most socks are one size fits all as long as your feet are under size 11 (US).I do wish the argyle print went all the way down to the foot, but I like them anyway.",
        "For a while now, I've been really disappointed by my local department stores' inventories on socks. Even the Gold Toe socks they carry typically aren't the best quality and the selections are very limited.So I decided to go online to see if I could find styles and quality I prefer, and took a chance ordering these Gold Toe socks.I am super-pleased. These are MUCH better quality than the stamped-on patterns and thinner material I tend to find at Kohls or Target. Of course, I'm spending more on these as well, but it's worth it to me to get this level of quality, style and presentation. Very happy.",
        "Socks look and fit great. Glad I purchased.",
        "I looked for this classic pattern at my local big mall but couldn't find any. All the large departmental stores now try to push their own brands. I am glad I found them here.",
        "As for socks, I only buy Goldtoe.  I buy the extra large ones that fit from 12 to 16, and Amazon is about the only place I can find those.  I wish there were more color/pattern options in the larger sizes though.  Can't beat Goldtoe quality and comfort.",
        "These socks are comfortable.  I love Gold Toe.  However they slip down more that any other Gold Toe socks I've had.  I do have enormous calves so that might have something to do with it, but I don't have this problem with other socks.",
        "Buen producto.  \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
        "Comfy. Perfect thickness. Nice designs (good variety too - no duplicates). No loose threads. No masses of thread in the corners of the toes. I\u2019ve honestly never bought socks before that didn\u2019t have at least one of these things wrong, until now.These won\u2019t roll down (as long as you pull them beyond the biggest part of the calf), but they don\u2019t strangle your leg as I\u2019ve seen other reviewers claim (and I have thick legs).They're socks... I don't know why I'm so motivated to write a review for them. I think I need to reflect on my life choices. #covidLiving"

I\u2019ve purchased them multiple times over the years. After a lot of use  the elastic starts to wear down and they start to bunch around my ankles, but that\u2019s also about the time I\u2019ve worn a hole in the heal so I get new ones.",

We don't have foot problems but like these anyway.  I don't know how they will last, but we've had them in the past for a reasonable amount of time.  Husband has size 8 Men's and I have size 10 Women's, and these sox fit us both.",

        "Following up on my original comment, below: These are wonderful!!! I don't know what explains the discrepancy I noted. Perhaps Dr. Scholls produced a new, improved version. In any case I am VERY pleased!I bought two pair on Oct. 2 and really liked them, so on Oct. 22 I bought four more pair. They arrived today. They seem almost as good BUT they are NOT the same as the ones I received three weeks ago. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE.??I checked my previous orders and the two are IDENTICAL, but the ones that arrived today are significantly larger. Fortunately they are very soft, as were the others, so they slip on easily. Bottom line: I would give the first ones I received five stars and I suspect the ones that arrived today will merit a five. I have shown four only because of receiving different ones than I expected.",
        "I am a woman, slim build and size 10.5 US shoe. I had a very bad leg injury and ever since my feet, ankles and calves are very tender. It is impossible to find women's socks that are large enough and not binding. I guess the manufacturers think we all wear size 7 shoes. Thank you Scholl's for continuing to make this particular sock. It is fairly thin, the calf part has loose ribbing and it does stay up without a tight band at the top of the sock. Also, my current pairs have been through many launderings and still fit and wear well.",

Other \"waterproof\" jackets I've owned caused me to sweat while wearing them, but not this jacket; it's more breathable than others.  The jacket runs large.  I'm a medium but find the small fits me, provided I'll be wearing only a t-shirt underneath.  The only downside for me was the fit across the chest I wish was roomier, but it's certainly passable.",

        "I don\u2019t write reviews that often - but I had to for this. These pants are honestly my absolute FAVORITE of all time.I take them to work, airplanes, backpacking, to the beach, lounging, bbq\u2019s, literally anywhere it\u2019s allowed.They are unbelievably comfortable, form fitting, strechy, and good looking. I\u2019ve never enjoyed wearing anything as much as this. As a 6\u20191\u201d, thin guy I have a tough time with pants - but I just ordered another set for myself and more for family.Buy them. Period.",
        "As the title states, these are my favorite pants for the City or Country in all casual settings, I have a pair in almost every color and a couple of duplicates, just in case. They are the antidote to high-priced, baggy outdoor or outdoor-inspired pants. They do require a few modifications to make them work in this way. First, buy them longer than you need, so you can get them hemmed.  Second, you have to cut off that half belt at the waist. It doesn\u2019t work and is ugly. Use a lighter to melt the frayed ends. They\u2019re under the belt loops so nobody will see. Just get a belt or have the waist modified to fit you better. Second, cut out the terrible bungee at the ankle. The toggle is on the inside and hurts. Once you\u2019ve pulled out the bungee and the toggle, take the pants to the cleaner or tailor or your mom and have them fold the existing hem and sew a new one and mod the waist if you want or need that. Then you\u2019ll have a pair of outdoor pants that to the naked eye look just like a pair of chinos. They\u2019re so lightweight that they\u2019re perfect for fishing or high sun activities where you want to stay cool, but need coverage. Quick dry and pack down well. They do need insulation to be warm so consider some thermals in colder weather.",
        "I\u2019m a high steel/production rigger and this line of pants are my new favorite. Keeps me cool and drys fast after a downpour. I don\u2019t even look at other pants anymore.",
        "I'm Asian, 5ft 7in, 154lbs, waist 31.5\" and bum 37\". Size 30X30 fits really well with me, slim fit makes you look very  sharp and  also very comfortable. I'm able to squat without feeling ripping the back of the pants. One thing, the inseam is definitely much longer than specified 30\". If you have long legs, it shouldn't be a problem.",
        "Nice style and acceptable fit, but pants ripped after about four hours of wear. My other Wrangler pants lasted much, much longer.",
        "5'8 175lb athletic build. Size 30x32 is literally the perfect fit for me. I've never had a pair a pants that fit this good and I'm about to buy multiples lol will wear them backpacking this weekend so we'll see how they perform. But they are super lightweight and the right amount of stretch.UPDATE: Wore them on a 15 mile hike in humid 83 degree weather. they aren't the most breathable pants but they are way tougher than I expected. about 2 miles of the trail was basically hiking through briar patches. Trail was barely visible with how dense the thicket/briars were and the pants held up perfectly. No tears or fraying. Definitely recommend these.",
        "I bought them for cycling when you need more than just shorts.  I was in between sizes and went a size smaller, but I wouldn't do that again - the integrated belt would allow you to size down if needed.  The clasp on that belt is great, as is the adjustment, so even though I barely got the button on the pants buttoned the belt held it all together and gave me confidence the pants wouldn't unbutton mid-activity.Wore these on a 2.5hr ride up and down a mountain, and shockingly I did not sweat through these nor was I cold on the descent.  It kept the wind and sun off me while my friend only wore shorts and had to deal with that.  I don't know how, my only guess is my sweat wicked to the pants and then evaporated very quickly because my chamois was damp, as expected, but the pants were not.  And of course I sweat elsewhere.  Very impressed, I'm actually thinking I'll be wearing these in warmer temps than I thought to help keep the sun off.They also have a cinch by the ankle to keep the pant leg opening from getting in the way.  The material is durable enough like any \"adventure\" pants.  If these had a cycling brand name, or some fancy outdoor brand, they'd probably cost 3-4x.  I'm already thinking about another pair one size up...",
        "I'm very picky when it comes to attention to detail and fit as well as looks. These pants are 10/10 all around. I wear them rucking and they keep me cool. Definitely worth the price.",

        "Fabric feels better quality than most other shirts,  a bit thicker and not as loose. Impressed with the construction of the collar, feels nice and thicker than other shirts, seems like it will last longer than my other crew necks. The noticeable stylish line in the middle back of shirt, I read review where someone said they could feel it while wearing but I don't seem to feel it even while I lie down or sit back.",
        "Nice cotton crew short sleeve shirt,  bought for husband he likes all cotton shirts (hard to find) ordered the 3 X fits great, have washed and dried no issues,  the back seam seems weird to me but it doesn't bother him since he is wearing this as a work out shirt.  over all very well pleased and have ordered 4 more.  need more colors like a grey or charcoal?  thanks!",
        "First impressions as soon as I opened the package was \"oh wow this is quality\". The shirt is heavy weight and feels good on the body. I love how high quality it feels and the off white color is perfect. Its a very fashionable, and good quality product.",
        "Bought these for my husband but they are soooo short. I wouldn't recommend for anyone over 5'10\". Got them for a great price so I am just going to keep them as oversized shirts for myself. Giving 3 stars because they are of nice quality, fabric is soft.",
        "Great fit, soft and thick material.  These are my everyday undershirts for a work dress.",
        "Bought this shirt for under $10 in both off white and black. Size is true,washes up beautifully without a wrinkle or shrinkage. Has a nice soft texture without feeling silky.",
        "I wanted less toxic clothing so I chose organic cotton but the voc's coming off this aren't acceptable.",
        "I love that this t shirt is made from organic cotton, and not gmo cotton, with petro fibers like polyester or nylon added to it. The shirt is just as soft as those regular cotton ones, and also is real sturdy too. Am very satisfied with this t shirt. Hope to order more in the future.",

        "Das T-Shirt sitzt sehr gut und der Stoff f\u00fchlt sich auf der Haut auch super an!",
        "This is one of my boyfriend's favourite t shirts as the material is lovely and soft - beautiful fabric like all the Amazon aware stuff we have.It washes and tumble dries really well and hasn't shrunk at all after several washes.Hasn't got misshapen at all and overall looks great even months down the line. I like that it's off white too so a bit different to your usual white t shirt.",
        "Well-made, thick cotton. On the pictures the sleeves seem longer but they are more like a regular t-shirt. Mind the non-functional decorative vertical seam on the back, you may sense it while wearing. All seams are flat, see the pictures. XS size t-shirt is 51 cm (20 inch) wide and 71cm (28 inch) tall. That may feel a bit \"longer\" compared to other t-shirts. In general, I tend to like Amazon clothing XS size when I usually wear S (rarely M) in other brands.",
        "Le tee-shirt est bien. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris de l'\u00e9paisseur du tissu par rapport au prix. Bon rapport qualit\u00e9/prix."

        "I ordered a pair of these pants for our trip to Alaska a couple months ago and couldn't be more happy with them. I did however try on a pair in a store but at the price of $60 I was not willing to spend that. I pick these up for half the price. They were comfortable to wear all day hiking in the Alaskan wilderness. Warm and flexible had enough room to bend and movement. Overall very comfortable pants and I would buy again.",

Having been in high school in the mid to late 90's I'm not a big fan of the tapered leg, but these don't bother me too bad. My only complaint is they wrinkle never easily and the wrickes don't come out with a run through the drier. I own several pair and will buy more.",

        "I followed a previous customer's advice to go 1 size lager (med to large) and the fit is good except the waist is a bit too large which was to be expected. Very happy with comfort and thermal qualities",
        "The shirts are too snug, feels more like a small than a medium. Though  shoulder width is just perfect , which still makes them wearable",
        "Quality seems fine overall. I ordered a medium because that's generally the size that fits me across brands but the underwear set was extremely tight on my biceps and thighs to the point that it's uncomfortable to wear them. If you work out regularly and are even a little bit muscular I'd really recommend sizing up at least one size over what you typically wear. I'm about 175 lbs 5'9\" and bought a medium but probably should have gotten at least a large.",
        "I recently purchased the Fruit of the Loom Men's Recycled Waffle Thermal Underwear Set in both neutral and greystone heather, and I'm thrilled with the quality and versatility.The 52% Cotton, 48% Polyester fabric blend strikes a perfect balance, offering a cozy feel and durability. The mini waffle texture adds a stylish touch, making these thermals almost fashionable enough to wear on their own.The moisture-wicking feature keeps me dry and comfortable, while the heat-retaining properties provide warmth without bulk. The tagless label ensures all-day comfort, and the U.S.-sourced cotton and recycled polyester reflect a commitment to quality and sustainability.Machine wash convenience adds practicality to these thermals, making them an ideal choice for any wardrobe. In summary, the Fruit of the Loom Men's Recycled Waffle Thermal Underwear Set is a reliable and eco-conscious option for stylish comfort in any season. Highly recommended!",
        "My husband works in the cold and these do the trick. My husband always complains that long John\u2019s are to hot or not hot enough but says these are the perfect fit. Keep him warm but when in a conditioned space not to hot. Deff a winner!",
        "While the top and bottoms are warm and the bottoms fit fine, the top is skin tight and cut in an odd way. I was never able to feel 100% comfortable with the top as it kept sliding up and leaving my back, belly, or sides exposed. I used them camping in 30\u00b0 Temps and didn't have a problem, but I wasn't particularly comfortable with the shirt. Perhaps order a size or two up",
        "The weather turned chilly, but I am warm and cozy. This is a really nice set, you get top and bottom in this thermal set. Good for sleeping in, and warm on a chilly work day too. The stretchy waffle design keeps a warm layer of air surrounding my whole body warm. The light weight construction,does not hinder me at all. Really nice.",
        "Really Comfortable really keep you warm I'm about to buy another pair in a smaller size they run a Little big",
        "For a 6ft tall, about 185lbs, broad shoulders, slim waist, overall slim athletic build type guy, the medium fits like a second skin, litterally. The top is rather tight ngl, but I like it, fits like a compression shirt, if your arm is bigger than 15inches in circumference you might want to go a size up because you wont fit, but if you\u2019re 15inches and below you will. The bottoms fit more reasonably, and you\u2019ll for sure keep your heat. M for that too even tho I run L in other attire. The only let down if any is that the material is rather coarse/harsh/not soft, but overall I\u2019m very happy, hope this helped!",

One of the standout features of this jacket is its length, which not only adds a stylish touch but also offers extra warmth. Because it's so long, my legs aren't as cold anymore, a welcome relief during chilly days. It's clearly designed for warmth, making it incredibly efficient in retaining heat. On many occasions, I've found that just a T-shirt underneath is sufficient, even on colder days. Overall, this DKNY jacket strikes the perfect balance between functionality and fashion. It's become a staple in my winter collection, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a stylish yet practical solution to stay warm during the winter months.",

        "I bought a pair of these sweatpants for my husband for Christmas last year and he loved them so much I bought him two more pairs in different colors. They are heavy, comfy, and so soft and warm. He's always cold and we live in Ohio so our winters can be frigid. He says these are the best sweats he's ever owned and the price was exceptional! BUT, suddenly the price increased $7 per pair and while they're still worth it, I'm disappointed at the price increase and haven't purchased anymore since. They wash up great. No pilling, stretching, and they look new a year later (and he lives in them) so the quality is worth the price but they're not the deal they used to be. I paid $8.99 per pair and last I checked they were $16 per pair. That's a drastic increase. Amazon sweats really are the best though and I highly recommend them. Have loose ankles, not baggy but not tight, and deep pockets. They look very nice, not sloppy. Can wear out, at home, or as pajamas. Recommend.",
        "I purchased the Amazon Essentials Men's Athletic-Fit Stretch Jeans a few months ago and have been consistently wearing them several times a week. Here's my take on these jeans:**Sizing (4/5):** I bought these jeans in a 30x30 in the Athletic-Fit, and while they are a bit loose in the waist, I attribute it to recent weight loss and the need to reevaluate my size. This isn't unexpected when one's body is changing, and it's worth considering a size adjustment.**Outstanding Comfort (5/5):** When it comes to comfort, these jeans are as good as it gets. They're on par with some of the most comfortable jeans I've ever worn. The \"Athletic-Fit\" and \"Stretch\" features make them a pleasure to wear for extended periods.**Top-Notch Quality (5/5):** The quality of these jeans is truly top-notch. I can confidently say that I've never worn a better quality jean, regardless of the price point. They feel durable and well-crafted.**Unique Design Choice (3/5):** There is one unique and somewhat odd design choice to note\u2014the fly is noticeably short, which can be uncomfortable. However, the overall excellence of these jeans has allowed me to work around this issue and grow accustomed to it.**Compliments (N/A):** While I haven't received specific compliments on these jeans, their quality speaks for itself.**Recommendation (5/5):** Without a doubt, I would highly recommend the Amazon Essentials Men's Athletic-Fit Stretch Jeans to others. They excel in terms of overall quality, comfort, and their reasonable price point. These jeans are an easy choice, particularly for denim wearers who prioritize quality over brand recognition.In conclusion, the Amazon Essentials Men's Athletic-Fit Stretch Jeans offer exceptional comfort, top-notch quality, and a reasonable price point. Despite a minor design quirk, these jeans are a solid choice for anyone seeking comfort and quality in their denim.",
        "Have had these since 2020. They are just now starting to fray. They fit perfectly as long as you know your size. Was surprised to see that they lasted me as long as they did. Definitely worth buy. They are super comfortable to wear and look great as well. Would recommend these to anyone looking for a quality product.",
        "I bought these jeans around 3 years ago. I\u2019ve worn them extensively (they\u2019ve become my daily driver pants in terms of use). The fit and style are good but the really amazing aspect is the durability. All this time and the jeans have no rips or tears anywhere. They still fit perfectly and look great. I was hesitant to buy them at first as I wasn\u2019t sure how good Amazon jeans could be. I stand humbly mistaken. It was money well spent.",
        "Ok, so I've gained a couple pounds and I want a Men's Pant that is what I'll call a Half Size Larger. Meaning I wanted a pair of jean type pants that are slightly larger than the 34 waist I usually buy.A size 36 is huge on me. I've been looking for a really stretchy 34 but cannot find in the style/color I want.Guess what, Amazon offers a Levi style pant in a 35\" waist. I took a flier and bought 2 pair thinking I'll return if a no-fit.Well, received/washed/dried and guess what, these puppies fit great. No  noticable shrink from received fitting and these actually have some stretch too. Great buy and thanks to whoever at Amazon came up with a Men's in-between size.",
        "These pants are comfortable, are true to size, and look as they are shown in the product photos. That said, from day 1 they have a weird chemical smell coming from them that is similar to the smell of mothballs. I've washed them 8 times now. I've tried washing them with white vinegar and with baking soda but the smell still exists. Whyyyyyyyyyy?!",
        "Too loose for my son. Offered to exchange, but he said he'd use a belt and that's what he's been doing.",
        "Siempre que quiero que me queden fit mis jeans voy a lo seguro con esta marca de Amazon la verdad la calidad es muy buena y las tallas vienen muy bien ya van varios que compro y todo perfecto",
        "***EDIT***I must apologize; I bought these jeans at the same time I bought the slim fit jeans by Amazon. I got confused as to which pair was which, the negative review I left for the athletic fit jeans was intended for the slim fit variant. Updated review for the athletic fit is below.These are a fantastic pair of jeans! From quality of material, to fit, to appearance I like them from top to bottom.The material is constructed of a beautifully stretchy material that moves with my body just how I need it to. I have gone through weight swings in the last year and these jeans have kept up just fine. They are breathable, as far as jeans go, very comfortable and they sit well on my waist. I am a big fan of stretchy jean material and Amazon has really hit their stride with this jean.Comfort aside, I think the jeans look great too. When I wear them, I feel like I look good in them, what more do you want? The colours are nice and solid, they have been through numerous washes and show no signs of fading, tearing, separating. They will have a significant bleed of blue when you first get them, even after the initial wash on receipt I found that my hands were consistently blue when wearing them that first time. After a second wash, the bleed was completely gone. If you wear white shoes, be aware that these will leave a blue stain on them if you do not double wash.I work in a chemical environment, and I don\u2019t hesitate to wear these jeans at work. Like any other denim, certain chemicals will make short work of the material, but these jeans have held up as well as any other pair that I own. At such a good price, I don\u2019t feel guilty about wearing them in a harsh environment and potentially ruining them, at least I\u2019ll look good doing it!Value for the money is definitely there, the quality:cost of these jeans is a great balance.I am a fan of these jeans and there are already several more pairs in my dresser!",

Inseam is 34\u201d so you\u2019ll probably need to cuff or hem.Overall, I found the fit suboptimal. They looked good on me, but the button fly was clumsy, and the fabric didn\u2019t want to move with me even though they are stretch denim. The fabric did not feel special - it\u2019s standard Levi\u2019s weight/thickness. I did appreciate that they were fully black throughout (no weird gray or faded) so you could probably wear in most smart casual and some business casual settings."

        "My son has been looking for a golf jacket that would not interfere with his swing. This completely fit the bill. He\u2019s very thin but the XS fits his arms and body closely as desired. The thumb holes are an unexpected bonus. It\u2019s warm enough for California winters but he keeps another layer in his bag for wind & rain.",

        "This is truly an outdoor fitness jacket. If you're looking for a light jacket for perusing the farmer's market on Saturday mornings, this probably won't work for you. The chest/bodice is lightly quilted and comfortable, but the sleeves, however, are nylon / spandex and are fitted. They're not necessarily tight, but there's not a lot of extra room. It's fitted with high armholes so it's comfortable while performing actual activities \u2013 running, jumping, climbing trees, you know, the usual. I'm very pleased with it, and will probably end up ordering all the other available colors.",
        "I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and warmth of this jacket for running.  I only wish Amazon sold it in lime green also.  Would buy another.",
        "For the price point this is a great jacket. I wear it when running and it breathes well while keeping me warm. My only critique is that the thumb holes in the sleeves don\u2019t allow for much flexibility.",
        "Loved the jacket overall - would be great as a light, early spring option. It does, however, run incredibly small, and by that I mean almost a full size small. My boyfriend wears a 2XL and I wear an XL. The 2XL I ordered for him didn\u2019t fit him at all but worked great for me. I also ordered myself an XL and it fit like I\u2019d wrapped myself in plastic wrap. The zipper being on the left made me question whether they accidentally sent me a women\u2019s size.",

        "Love these socks and recommended them to a couple people and they loved them as well and it's everyone's favorite sock. You have padding in all the right places, and they keep your feet warm when it's cold YET it's breathable and moisture wicking when it's hot outside too! My feet are really prone to blisters even in high quality comfortable shoes and these socks greatly reduce how often I get blisters. They will shrink a bit in the dryer so if you are between sizes you should go to the larger one to account for that. They fit snug and perfect like a glove for me, no excess or moving around. They have a tab in the front and back of the ankle area to reduce friction there from your shoe. They are pricey for one pair but they are WORTH IT. I have washed and worn them a lot and they are holding up great, not stretching out or thinning out.",
        "I love this brand the socks are comfortable I\u2019m very cushy",
        "I love these socks as they don\u2019t slip, they wash well and come in many colors.  They also come in different thicknesses. I have a small foot and wear the medium in women\u2019s. They are expensive, but I think worth it.",
        "These are heaven! Love the cushion and the way the hold to my foot. They wick away the moisture and hold up through a heavy long shift on concrete. Never thought I\u2019d see myself paying this much for a pair of Sox\u2019s but I am going back for a second pair.",
        "The Feetures socks are a s excellent choice for serious runners.  My daughter runs on the Cross Country Team in highschool,  and these are her absolute favorite socks for her runs.  She loves the comfort, fit, and choice of colors.  She also loves the way they make her feet feel as she runs daily 6+ miles.  However, they are definitely cost prohibitive for large families.  We buy her one pair every so often instead of many pairs at once.",
        "The compression and extra cushion in these are incredible. I can\u2019t run without them!",
        "I began wearing Feetures maybe 2 years ago.  I don't like the price per pair but I was tired of buying socks and getting holes in them after just a few times wearing them.  I initially heard of Feetures from Nick Bare on one of his YouTube videos so I decided to give them a try.  I've bought several pairs and love them.  If you're looking for a sock with a lot of cushion, this is not it.  Even the max cushion is very thin in my opinion, but I love the compressive fit of the socks.  I love being able to pull my shoe off and my sock stays in place.  They are also extremely durable.  I try to stay quite active and have weight trained, walked, hiked, ran, and cycled hundreds of miles if not thousands in these socks and they're still fine.  $15-20 per pair is expensive but considering they will last at least a few years, I think it's worth it.  I would probably buy more pairs if they were closer to $10 per pair but I still love them regardless and highly recommend them.",
        "I prefer wearing \"invisible\" socks, but maybe it's the way I walk, the socks often slip into my shoe making it uncomfortable to walk.  It's very annoying.A friend told me about this brand of socks and how they not only stay up, they are designed for arch support and can prevent blisters.  These are also issues I experience besides my falling socks, when I go for long walks.I bought these from Amazon because the price is $1 less than direct through the manufacturer, unless I buy in multi-packs.  I didn't want a 6-pack of the same colour.  Since I have Prime, I was able to order these in black, white and gray.These have become my favourite socks when I go out for walks.",

        "I've been through some bad/weird or ill fitting hoodies. Generally have preferred Nike but chose to try out Champion to see if they produced a proper fitting standard XL. These strike a nice balance between basic looking and stylish. I feel they are a little big for size, in arm length and total length, but not by much. Apparently they shrink a bit, so I am trying to shrink them a wee bit to see if I can get the size perfect.I like hoodies that are soft enough to wear without an undershirt sometimes, and these qualify. My only criticism is that I really wish there was more color diversity. I'm a big fan of Texas orange, because I like to walk around my house eating a box of dry Cheerios and chuffing at my own jokes. Due to the lack of Texas orange, this experience is a bit diminished.Overall I still like Champion gear. Other older brands are often overdone these days, Hanes is too cheap, etc. And there is a proliferation of weird Chinese and other import brands on Amazon now. Champion still seems to maintain a relatively high quality of materials, while not going crazy with weird designs.",

        "Do NOT expect the jacket to be thick and warm.  This is a light weight jacket, with a thin soft inner fleece (?) layer inside.  I was pleasantly surprised that the seams are taped.  I find the wind and water resistance to be good; keep in mind this is a softshell jacket (not a hardshell jacket), so do not expect it to be 100% water/wind proof.  Also, the fit of the jacket is on the \"sporty\" side; if you have a big belly, the waist area of the jacket might feel tight.  Overall, I am very happy with the jacket, and I primarily use it at the start of morning spring/autumn hikes.",
        "This jacket is not at all the quality of my 20 year old Marmot jacket. It is thin, uncomfortable and the arms actually crinkle like plastic when you move. Also, as others have said the collar is way too tall - I tried it on for 10 seconds and immediatly took it off and returned it.",
        "I needed something to transition from fall and spring. This jacket covers all the bases for me-light weight, rain resistant with taped seams and wind proof. It has large zippered side pockets and a smaller zippered inner chest pocket suitable for a smartphone. I have found it perfect for 65\u00b0F down to 45\u00b0F. It is not baggy, i.e., is trim fit; therefore, is not suitable for thick layers of clothing beneath. Marmot clothing has a lifetime guarantee against defects in materials, which I find reassuring.",
        "Fits just like the old one but with a better outside material.",
        "I have been buying and using nearly exclusively marmot jackets for last 15 years. This is the first jacket that I don't even know if I can use - and only because of (huge) oversized collars. If you look at the product photos, it looks as if its normal collar size but this person must have very long neck. Even worse, they did not make a photo of the unzipped jacket because it just doesn't look good with oversized collars. They are TWICE as large as any other of the 5-6 jackets in the same size I had over the years (e.g. Marmot Approach or Marmot Gravity).",
        "Not like the marmot gravity jacket so don\u2019t think this is a replacement",
        "Had high hopes for this jacket. Despite checking multiple size guides it was too tight in the shoulders. And that collar.. what was the designer thinking?? Not like in the pictures at all. Had to return and chose a Sch\u00f6ffel Avdalen which is just wow. Such a good cut"

They are a perfect length on me, though I suspect the 31.5\" inseam is more like 30.\" If you are tall these might ride up like capris.The Under Armor logo is annoying; it is stiff and feels like it should peel off, but it does not.Otherwise, these are perfect.",

        "I must agree with the reviewers who say that the calf section of the legs on this item are sized oddly small.  I bought a 2XL size and do not have big calves and the legs are a bit too slim.  Not tight, just too slim.  I don't notice it at all when standing up, but I do when sitting.  All that said, I really like these.  They are soft, very comfortable, and the other aspects of the fit are perfect.  Great waist-band that does its job without being restrictive or abrasive.  Material is mid-weight--not just thin jersey and not to heavily fleecy.  Nearly perfect for my need and I intend to purchase another pair.  If you can live with the calf fit, I would highly recommend these.",

        "Just used the Frogg Togg's mens jacket with their bib on a week long sail excursion(s) on the Kenai Fjords out of Seward, Alaska where it was cloudy, windy, cold and rainy the entire time.  Very light weight, and easy to slip on and off.  Material is very durable and kept me dry.  The pockets were well placed and came in handy to keep items like glasses, sunscreen, and my \"Relief Band\" motion bracelet safely stowed.  I even put my wallet in one of the pockets, which was also kept dry.  When not in use the the rain gear stows away where is doesn't take up much space (think military poncho liner).  The hood of the jacket was the weakest link of the jacket.  The hood attached to the jacket with a zipper.  The hood would easily unzip itself (detaching from the jacket), and it is kind of a hassle to zip it back up while on a rolling sailboat while wearing a PFD.  And, I found it difficult to zip it back while wearing gloves.  When using the hood, I did not like how it restricted my field of vision, but you get used to that.  Better to keep warm/dry with a limited field of vision than be wet, cold, and miserable.  It does keep your head dry with enough room to wear a knit cap.  The jacket fit was loose enough to wear layers of warm clothing underneath as this rain suit will not keep you warm, but will shield you from the cold winds.  The jacket did not impede movement or flexibility for the operation of a pitching and rolling sailboat.  Highly recommended.",
        "I heavily researched rain gear before deciding to pull the trigger on Frogg Toggs Pilot.  I purchased the jacket and bibs.  This is rain gear that has a waterproof rating superior to suits costing hundreds of dollars more.  It's not meant to keep you warm like a coat (if you need warmth, buy the liner for the jacket) but it will keep you dry and keep the wind off you.  My only reluctance to purchasing it was the sizing chart on the Frogg Toggs web site; using their sizing chart, I could wear small bibs and a medium jacket.  I'm six feet and weigh 230 pounds.  I wear size 36 waist pants and have a 47 inch chest.  I purchased the \"Large\" bibs and the \"Extra Large\" jacket; the fit is perfect.  This rain gear is rugged, however it is not quiet. I purchased it for fishing and other outdoor activities not related to hunting.  If you want \"quiet\", spend the extra bucks and buy gortex lined soft silent fabric.  Don't confuse this rain gear with Frogg Toggs inexpensive gear that feels like \"tyvek\"; this is real rain gear that will last for several years.",
        "This is a perfect wind/rain jacket. It's very durable and I love the highlighted zippered waterproof pockets. I gave the jacket overall 5 stars but I do have one gripe and that's the hood. The hood just kind of flaps and hangs there and after a while, it begins to unzip itself.  My biggest concern is that I might lose the hood and I'm afraid if I take it off to store it that I might miss place or lose it. I have seen other rain /wind jackets with a better design and wish that a little more effort was put into that aspect of the jacket.",
        "The jacket is nice overall. The option of the insulated jacket or vest is handy and makes the jacket that much more versatile. It's light enough for a summer rain jacket that is very windproof and with the additional insulation option im comfortably wearing it fishing tournaments in November here in Michigan still with just a shirt and hoodie underneath. My only complains are the hood and the sleeves. The sleeves seen short at times like reaching down into livewells. They pull up my arms and I bend down and reach. For me it's almost a bonus but not everyone is going to appreciate that. The hook has a nice zipper for removal but the hook doesn't have its own pocket to roll up in or anything, it just detaches with a quality zipper and you do what you wish after that.I found the jacket here for a great price and I'm totally happy with it for that price ($80 or so). However full price would make me a little less impressed. I do like it as much or more than the Huk tournament jacket it replaced.",
        "I love this thing!  It fits well over a jacket, but is also adjustable to fit without a jacket.  I've had several chances to wear it already.  I teach the motorcycle course, and we've been having many rainy days.  The hand-warmer pockets are a godsend when the rain and wind chill the air.  The hood is nice as well, and covers my head even if I still have my Tilley hat on.  This jacket is definitely worth the money.  I also bought the bib pants, and they are awesome, too.  The side pouches hold my teaching materials, so I don't have to worry about where I'm going to put them, as I did with my other rain pants.  I'm 5'11\", 215 pounds, bought both in large, and they both fit very well, once you get it adjusted to your size.",
        "Excellent fit, build and thoughtful design.  This has waterproof pockets galore both in and outside the main coat zipper.  Seams are all taped and it was done correctly.  Removable hood.  The jacket has cuffed inner sleeves which are further cut and tapered in such a way so when you're actually using your arms, the cuffs aren't in the way and you don't have water running up both your arms.  Nice.  Imagine that a raincoat that is useful in the rain. If there is a more thoughtfully designed and tougher jacket out there, I just don't know of it or who makes it.  I'll be buying another one of these if this one ever wears out, but it looks like that may be a bit.",
        "I finally got to try this jacket out over the weekend and all I can say is Wow!. Very comfortable, kept me dry on the water and kept me very warm. Has lots of pockets to hold your valuables which is a big plus especially when on a boat. The material is great and very breathable. Do yourself a favor and just buy it! Dont go spending over 300$ at bass pro shops like I almost did because this jacket is so worth it.",
        "These are not the Frogg Toggs you find at you local big box sporting goods. These are premium material premium craftsmanship. I would compare them to a simms or aftco set. I wore them the other day on the lake fishing all day in a constant steady rain with temps in the low 40s with a pretty standard base layer and stayed warm and dry all day. Highly recommend.",
        "Mejor de lo que esperaba",
        "Fully tested in Alaska trip.  Handled rain like a champ.",
        "Have worn this jacket on 4 or 5 occasions when the rain could be described as torrential, it has remained totally waterproof, it has a good selection of pockets and the sleeves have inner and outer Velcro cuff closures, there are a number of D rings to use , the hood is attached with a zip and works well when in use but feels odd when down. Now  to sizing which is the strangest I have come across , I am a 40 inch chest which in the UK and Europe is medium, I ordered a medium and disappeared inside this jacket, I then ordered a small which is still very baggy on me, when I looked at the size chart the USA small is a 46 inch chest and medium is a 48 inch chest,mystery solved! Be aware of this issue and order accordingly, to summarise its a great waterproof jacket and highly recommended",
        "Jacket showed up and was as described. However, the jacket reeked. At first we thought weed/marijuana from shipping. So we washed it (thus tag removal) only to find out it was worse. Probably skunk.We have washed the jacket, soaked it and have been airing it out for 3 weeks.So jacket would be great IF I could wear it. No issues with Frogg Toggs but the seller must have known the issues.",

These shirts are true to size, so don't do as I did and just order it in your normal size."

Unlike nearly all other dozens of coats I've tried, this one actually allows room for biceps and chest and the stretch fabric helps even more.  Don't understand the skinny fetish of the current clothes designers.  All they do is make the coats and jackets for skinny, pencil necked, atrophy muscled, malnourished, emaciated models.  (Why make everything so narrow cut when 72% of the population is overweight - about 40% is actually obese.!)  If you have ANY muscles or a few extra pounds, then probably only this coat will fit you.  I don't like to show labels, and this one had 2 very small ones.  It was easy to use a thin, black marker to quiet the 2 logos.",

I\u2019ve found use for the underarm vents much more than expected when on beach hikes or in warmer climate. I have also used the jacket as a shell in a winter storm, and found the hood and all ergonomics of the jacket to work well when under brittle and difficult conditions. Finally, I really like the inlay of the jacket; that\u2019s just a personal note, but take it as you will.",

I live in a sub tropical climate so there is no way I wouldn't expect some condensate build up.  The fit is typical of Columbia jackets and tops",

So, purchased this rain coat in a medium and it fits right on for his build.We are a family who wears Columbia head to toe for many years. This rain coat does its job. No leaking at seams. Enough pockets for day hikes and regular use in our suburb and city lifestyle. Color isn\u2019t too bright - which is nice.  It\u2019s specifically a rain coat (not a winter coat) so it is thin and lightweight. My husband will layer for more warmth or wear over his Mountain Hardwear water resistant coat.",

        "07/02/2023: I was looking to supplement/replace some equivalent (2016 & 2019 purchased) Calvin Klein boxer briefs that have been excellent.  However they are still about $10 per brief and recent reviews on their quality have not been kind.  So I decided to look at this brand instead which have averaged me about $3.50 per brief for three packs of 5 so far.  I wear a 34\u201d jeans size, so I decided to get the large.  It fit, but felt a bit loose.  They didn\u2019t slide down at all, but I did wonder if the elastic might stretch over time.  So the next two purchases were for the medium size.  They are snug, but not tight.  There are some decent color/pattern options with enough variety for most tastes, but you can\u2019t ever go wrong with black.  They are thin, but not flimsy, and very soft.  No idea on how they will last yet but pleased so far.  There is one more pattern combination I will get if the price drops below $20 for 5, which is where it is at now.  For those of you who wonder, yes, they are made in China.",
        "They fits perfectly fine, they are true to size I reordered for my boyfriend... he love it!",
        "For the price, these boxer briefs were top-notch and I would recommend them to anyone else looking to buy. These are the first boxers I've ever had that did not have a front fly opening. I thought I might not like them because of that but I have barley noticed. They were are a good price, soft, seem well made, and I liked the options of colors. I would recommend to anyone and I would buy again.I knocked 1 star off for sizing. They seem a little smaller than the medium size I am used to.",

They are very comfortable and provide support similar to a brief but feel like boxer briefs. Most of the material is a spandex reinforced synthetic that is very comfortable. They are several panels of breathable material that vents sweat and moisture. The fly doesn't gap open like many briefs and boxers. I have worn them in the summer and winter with equal results. Love them!",
        "First things first...whoever decided men's boxer briefs should have a pocket deserves a raise.  This is a game changer.  The pocket is great for storing your smartphone when you need a secure place to store it while doing physical activity.  The cup is snug and provides just the right amount of room and support without being too snug.  Hammock works well and prevents parts from sticking.  Mesh material provides a nice welcome cooling effect for the undercarriage.  While the material feels thinner than previous versions, these seem to be of good quality and have held up to several washings.  Will definitely be buying more in the future if the pocket feature is still available.",

I also love that you get 3 different colors in one package, making it a great option if you want to wear them as normal shirts.My only one complaint is that the logo on the front seems like it will peel off after just a couple washes, but I am hoping that is not the case.",

        "Very good/excellent quality and decent fit. True to size for a fitted large, although it's a bit tight in the shoulders (I wear an XL in Collezioni t-shirts, and 44R in their suits). I bought these shirts to have a more refined, polished t-shirt with some structure, and a more upscale look and feel, but without a lot of adornments or creative stitching and construction - just something basic. The navy and grey shirts fit that bill well, but the shirts are moderately lightweight/thin, so the white shirt is slightly see-through. It's a nice, soft cotton, but note that it's just a regular cotton, not a mercerized cotton as with many designer t-shirts (however, it's Emporio, so it's understandable). The Emporio Armani logo is small and subtle, but it is visible, so keep that in mind if you're either a) looking for something that shouts Armani, or b) you're looking for something that does *not* shout the brand (but hey, it's just a t-shirt...).",

        "I am so happy with this t-shirt! It fits perfectly, the fabric is soft and comfortable, and the price is very reasonable. I would definitely recommend this t-shirt to anyone looking for a great quality, affordable option.The t-shirt is made of 100% cotton, which makes it very soft and comfortable to wear. It also has a nice stretch to it, so it moves with your body and doesn't feel tight or constricting. The fit is true to size, so I would recommend ordering your usual size.I have washed this t-shirt several times and it has held up well. The color has not faded and the fabric has not shrunk. I am very impressed with the quality of this t-shirt and I would definitely recommend it to others.Overall, I am very happy with this t-shirt. It is a great quality, affordable option that fits well and is made of soft, comfortable fabric. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new t-shirt.",
        "These shirts are a great fit. Soft and durable. I have a dozen of them.  However, it requires you to be in good shape or else they will reveal \"too much\".",
        "I recently purchased the Gildan Men's Cotton Stretch T-Shirts Multipack, and while they have their merits, they didn't quite meet my initial expectations. I'd give them four stars overall because they're excellent undershirts but not suitable for standalone wear.On the positive side, these shirts are comfortable and have a nice fit for an undershirt. They are slightly tighter, which is perfect if you want a snug fit underneath another shirt. The cotton stretch fabric is soft and feels good against the skin, making them suitable for all-day wear as an undershirt.However, I had hoped that these T-shirts could double as standalone shirts, and that's where they fell short. The main drawback is that they are see-through, which means they're not ideal for wearing on their own. This limits their versatility and makes them primarily suited for layering.So, if you're in the market for quality undershirts that provide a comfortable fit and are easy to layer under other clothing, these Gildan T-shirts are a great choice. But if you're looking for shirts to wear solo, you might need to explore other options. Overall, a solid four-star rating for their intended purpose.",
        "I bought these as workout/lay around the house shirts.  They fit true to size and are very soft.  They can be worn for any occasion, not just undershirts.",
        "When I shop locally I can only find 100% cotton shirts; which are stiff after a few washings. The Gildan shirts have 5% spandex which is just enough to help them stay soft and flexible without the overstretched feeling you can get with some mesh shirts. They feel like a heavier fabric than the brands I've used previously; a great \"hand\" feel.  I have already placed a second order.",
        "Loved this shirts which I use as undershirts under my formal shirt. Good quality, soft and at a good price.",
        "Better than what I expected. Great fit and good quality. My husband was very happy",
        "I keep looking for long lasting stretch t-shirts.  I couldn't try this before buying it, but it felt pretty good when I first put it on out of the box.However, after one wearing and wash it was stretched out (more than the spandax should allow), and it wouldn't fit well.  The collar was gapping, and the shirt bunched under other shirts.Time to keep looking for other options.",
        "Nice and soft, fit nicely. I have only worn one and have not washed them yet. I imagine, like all my shirts, I will cold water wash and hang to dry. So they should be fine. Well worth the price.",
        "Muy buen producto",
        "Compraba hace unos a\u00f1os unas marca Zaga, de composici\u00f3n 95% algod\u00f3n y 5% elastano. Por alguna raz\u00f3n las dej\u00e9 de encontrar a la venta.Afortunadamente est\u00e1s se sienten igual y ajustan perfecto al cuerpo, como ropa interior.",
        "Followed wash/dry instructions - t-shirts shrunk significant amount.If you want to buy, I'd recommended going 2sizes too big.",
        "Die Qualit\u00e4t der Shirts ist super. Formbest\u00e4ndig, sehr angenehm zu tragen.Es sind allerdings US Gr\u00f6\u00dfen, das hatte ich \u00fcbersehen und meine Shirts in L sind sehr locker, fast zu gro\u00df, obwohl ich diese Gr\u00f6\u00dfe in EU trage."

        "This is the most awesome jacket that  I have ever had in my life!!!It looks 100 times better in person than it does in the pictures. It's like one of those pieces of clothing that you instantly fall in love with when you see it.Almost everyone gives me compliments about my jacket, all my family, friends, coworkers, and even strangers!!! I've never owned a piece of clothing where I got so many compliments before.I have owned a lot of jackets too, from 300 dollar leather motorcycle jackets to popular name brand jackets, and this jacket beats them all, and also has gotten the most compliments from EVERYONE!!!Without the hood, it looks like one of those cool futuristic GQ jackets with the popped up collar.A jacket like this would be worth 200 dollars at Macy's or something, and I feel like I got more than my money's worth.The jacket is really heavy duty. It is made of a canvas type of fabric, kind of like school backpacks, and it has some kind of water-proof layer on the underside of the fabric. Most jackets are made of plastic, leather or cotton/wool fabric, and I have never seen any jacket made of this canvas type of material before, which is really cool and unique.The jacket has some weight to it, but it's not super heavy. It also has tons of pockets, like 10 pockets total.It keeps me warm in 20 or 30 degree weather, and I can't even feel the wind at all. My co-workers were like \"He's walking around like it's a nice day!!!\", which is what it felt like to me, even tho it was 30 degrees outside with freezing cold windchill.At work in a super cold warehouse, I just wear a t-shirt underneath this jacket, with long johns underneath my jeans, some gloves, and a hat, and I am super toasty and comfortable all day.I wear my jacket at work all day everyday, in a super cold warehouse where I am driving a forklift, and lifting boxes, and stacking pallets, and I have also put the jacket through the washing machine multiple times, and it is holding up really well. There are no damage to the seams, no tearing, or cuts, or pilling, and no damage to the drawstring clasps.When I was reading all the reviews before I bought the jacket, I was worried about the seams tearing, or the drawstring clasps breaking, but I didn't have any of those problems at all. I think those people were just unlucky.And also the drawstrings, and the drawstring clasps on my jacket are grey, instead of black like in the pictures of the bad reviews. I think they must have fixed it or replaced it since those old reviews were posted, and it is 2020 now.The drawstrings goes around the very bottom inside of the jacket, like around the waist, and I never use it, and I don't think most people would ever use it, unless they were in Antarctica or snowboarding or something.I actually think this jacket is way way BETTER than those shiny plastic puffy looking North Face jackets. And this jacket cost a lot less too!!!I rate this jacket a 10 out of 10. And if you are thinking about getting it, then do it, you won't regret it.P.S. The jacket runs a little big, so if you normally wear a medium, and like your jackets to be more slim fit, then order a small.",
        "Very well made, good design, lightweight, warm, for a very attractive price, a comfortable winter jacket.",
        "I bought it as a spare rain jacket. Now it\u2019s my go to rain jacket. Absolutely love it. Great fit. Warm but it doesn\u2019t overheat you. Comfortable to wear, looks good. Very durable. I have had it for a year. I paid 74$ for it. I say grab it now for a lot less.,.",
        "I really like the design of this coat in lots of ways.  It's warm, the outer shell is tough nylon material that seems waterproof so far, there's every kind of pocket you could hope for, it fits me well.  Not a technical coat for climbing mountains or ski-ing, but perfect for walking around town in unpredictable conditions.  And the reflective strips are great.But ... the lining material is very thin, and within a couple of months it's fraying in places.  The loop for hanging it up is only attached to the liner, so that pulled the liner apart already.What can you expect for $65 or so ?  It's good value, and they had to save money somewhere, and it will be ok for a couple of seasons.  It just won't hold up long.  And that's a shame because the rest of the design is brilliantly thought out and functional and comfortable.  If they improved the lining and made it an $80 coat it would be a total winner.I got the steel color, and it's darker than it looks in the picture, dark blue.",
        "I live in the Midwest, where the weather can be super unpredictable. I ordered this coat when the weather forecast temps in the teens and wind-chills in the negatives. I only owned a super lightweight hoodie and was definitely hoping this blind buy wasn't a waste of my money and that it would at least keep me half way warm. This coat surpassed all of my expectations! Not only is it a decent weight, the fit is spot on. It has kept me warm in single digit temps, shields the wind, and repels the rain. If you're looking for a coat for the winter months, I absolutely recommend this one! Well spent money, indeed.",
        "I've had this jacket for 3 years. It still looks like new. It is very warm, firm on the body, all zippers are great still, generous pockets and good look. It is definitely a high quality jacket.I am 5.9, 186lb, and a medium fits me well",
        "2nd jacket; love the fit, lots of pockets, warm on cold days and rainy days",
        "I live in the Midwest so it gets quite cold. It definitely keeps me warm in -20 degree weather. I also love the pockets, very stylish looking, and for the price you can\u2019t beat it",
        "La compr\u00e9 para un viaje a Canad\u00e1 en invierno y de verdad cumple con lo que promete.",
        "Bought this for working in Quebec, area quite cold. Found when real windy I could feel the cold a little, otherwise this parka is warm and comfortable.  Quality is very good.  Zipper heavy duty and works well. Has reflective strips which are a bonus.  Lots of pockets inside and out.  Very happy with it, and worth the purchase.",
        "My husband has yet to wear, he\u2019s tall, 6\u20192, and wanted to wear layers under, he got the 4X. He\u2019s a big guy, broad shoulders. It\u2019s more than enough and he can wear some layers under.So far he\u2019s very happy. Let\u2019s see how it does in -40!",
        "This jacket is well constructed and heavily layered for very cold winter temperatures. The zippers, snap buttons and velcro components are also sturdy",
        "Est\u00e1 muy bien. Ligeramente m\u00e1s grade de lo que quisiera, pero nada que incomode."

My one problem, which I have with the way all soft shell jackets fit, is that while a size small is fine in the midsection (5\u20199\u201d 155), it\u2019s snug in the chest/neck area, but I do have a slightly broader chest.

        "Mid-calf height perfect for winter walking. Keep feet warm in low hiking shoes. Launder beautifully. An excellent buy at this price. Been wearing Gold Toe socks for decades because of quality and durability. These will undoubtedly prove that again.",
        "Correct size, comfortable, durable",
        "These  socks are designed for durability and comfort.  The seams, which are structural weak points, are minimal.  The material is uniform, but thick and comfortable.  They have endured the first wash very well.  My shoe size is 12 EEEE.  I ordered extra large and the fit is great.",
        "I was looking for gym socks that could handle a size 12 1/2 foot. Comfortable and they appear durable but they are difficult to get on, especially the arch area.",
        "I've had these socks before and liked them very much. I was not disappointed with this latest purchase. They are comfortable and fit well. They are well made. While not necessarily inexpensive, I believe they are worth the price.",
        "Have bought these for years.  They stand up well to repeated wearing, machine wash, dry.  This time tried the XL size for man (6', over 200lbs with muscular legs) and woman (thick calves).  These have worked much better than diabetic socks (those were loose on top but too thin) and others that have been tried in an effort to minimize restriction at the top of the sock.  And the gold toe XL socks don't slip down and don't bind at top.  Not as warm as wool, but very acceptable for all season.  Man wears year-round.  Toe is well defined but heal is minimally defined, so socks too big in the foot still fit fine, just pull up the calf a bit further.",
        "Best socks ever, they hold up better than any other socks that I've bought for my roommate bought them several times very comfortable in fact I'm told not to buy any other kind I recommend these they also make them for woman which I have some and I agree best sock ever",
        "I love the gold toe socks, very adorable, long, lasting, and very comfortable",
        "After 2 months of wearing these socks almost daily, I can now say that they are both comfortable and durable. The top doesn\u2019t sag, the internal elastics are still as good as new.",
        "I have bought these socks for 3 grandsons and they love them. I bought them for myself as well. Great socks.",

        "Small Tall/Long size is amazing for my teen boys with 26-28 waist and 36-38\" inseams.  I bought them each a pair.  Great Columbia quality, as expected.  Just so thrilled to find quality ski pants in a Small, but Long/Tall size!",
        "...I had them. I got these for Michigan lakeshore winters - cold temps, high winds, deep lake effect snows. These felt way too thin to be effective. Or if they did keep out the wind, I thought they'd feel like wearing trash bags. And on first outing (20\u00b0F, high wind), I thought, \"nope\"...until I started moving. Within 5 minutes of walking and generating some body heat, I was comfortable. The reflective liner does a great job of capturing/retaining heat while still being breathable. I imagine for more strenuous activity, the groin vents might be welcome to dump some extra heat.Maybe a few more \"bells and whistles\" than I needed for dog walking and snow shoveling, but satisfied with this purchase.  Easy to put on and take off. Being thin, they were easier to move in than more traditional, bulky snow pants. The only negative is that they are a bit noisier than expected, but the dog doesn't seem to mind.",
        "I'm not sure what you should stash in these pants but they're decent for snow and they keep you warm when it's cold.  Used them a few times and although they are a bit long, they fit great.  You can get these in a shorter length.  My bad! I didn't look close enough at the size chart.  I can wear these with lightweight denim pants underneath so it's easy to pull them off and you're ready for....whatever!  Different colors may cost more or less and sizes may not be available in certain popular colors.",
        "These pants fit great and feel really comfortable",
        "Look like decent pants, would probably keep you dry, but they are very thin and aren\u2019t going to do much to keep you warm in the snow",
        "I have looked far and wide for tall snow pants.Tall \u201834\u2019?  Yeah, there are a few brands.Extra Tall \u201836\u2019?  These are the only style I have ever found.Excellent.Also, these fit nice in the leg/knee, not too tight/slim.Nice material - not the cheaper \u2018swishy\u2019 stuff.Only problem is the 36L only comes in big sizes XL and up.  Large - 36L would be great.",
        "These are the best all around snow pants I own now. I  am 6\u2019 tall and weigh 195 and large fit me perfectly. I wish I would\u2019ve purchased them sooner.",
        "As advertised but I'd like the bottom to be black rather than blue.",
        "These snow pants are worth the money. Went down a few times in slush while skiing, and every time no water got in. Water comes off of them pretty fast which shows the waterproofing of these pants is great. Was kept warm and dry throughout my entire skiing trip. Would definitely recommend.",
        "They are roomy and support well at the waist.  Lots of zip pockets to make sure your stuff doesn\u2019t fall out.  Vents at the groin so you don\u2019t get too hot.Wore them for the first time in a wet snow blizzard on the ski hill last week.  Bone dry.",

        "They fit well, the fabric is very soft.  i only have two grips.  The cargo pockets aren't big enough for my iPhone max pro.  But it does fit in the main pockets.  Those are very deep.  The other grip is the belt loops are too small for my go to belt.UPDATE: With some finesse and determination I was able to get my belt through the loops.  They really are great shorts.",
        "I have had several pairs of these over many years and have loved them. They are an appropriate inseam length and not the defective pants that folks like to call \"shorts\" these days. The technology pocket is awesome and the reason I buy these. I can't believe nobody else does this.The complaints about belt loop size seem off the mark -- they're the same as ever and just fine. The sizing is also the same. I have a couple older surviving pairs to compare against. These may be slightly thinner material than older specimens, but I didn't get out the micrometer to check. How well they hold up is another question. Stay tuned. I have only worn them for a couple months, but no complaints at all so far. My only complaint is the significant price increase from days of yore, but such is life.",
        "True to size, these shorts look and feel good right out of the package.  With  Well designed  pockets and velcro closing flaps, no ironing is necessary.You will want more than one pair of them.",
        "While the stretch fabric is great in the waist, the fabric stretches too much in the hips, so that it begins to look like I'm wearing bloomers, and my used-to-be cute butt is no longer is visible. I washed my pair in Hot Water, hoping it would shrink and fade, but it did not. Thankfully, the width of the legs fits above the knees, unlike so many cargo shorts that, if the wind is strongly blowing, you could sail a few feet because of your bellowing leg holes. I usually wear a 36 waist (I'm 5'11\", 190 pounds), but I purposely bought a size 34, which fits me fine in the waist. So, if you don't wan't to have your shorts fall off your hips, buy a waist size smaller (because the fabric stretches). The construction quality is fine, and the price is right. I hope the company lessens the stretch in the hips, and adds a wonderful tech pocket on the left side, as well as the right side, and adds more color choices.",
        "Bought several pairs of this brand years ago. They have lasted many years. A couple pair are just started showing the wear & tear of every day use. Hunted every where this brand. Finally I went on Amazon & my replacement shorts were there. I made me a happy camper.\ud83d\ude04",

        "There's a lot of debate over who makes the best tanks. I am-- I'll admit-- a huge Uniqlo fanboy. The issues there are in their pricing and wonky sizing. Hanes are the work horse that you can count on to put in the effort no matter what. Sizing is always consistent, they last decently long for the price, and they always make you look good. And-- oh-- you get a bunch of junk on it at the gym that won't come off? Just toss it and get a new 6 pack later. Or just wear your stained ones. I guess that's an aesthetic too.",

        "I like that the material is soft and light.  It's very comfy and keeps me cool during the summer.",
        "I bought this tank primarily as an undershirt that would also look nice by itself. It has worked perfectly for that use so far. As a tall, somewhat slim build guy, it\u2019s difficult to find stuff that fits. The slim fit on these helps reduce the bulk in the torso that is a problem for most shirts. The material is soft and comfortable. I don\u2019t machine dry so I can\u2019t say if they shrink. Size is XL, 193cm, 98kg.",
        "The slim fit could have been made a little slimmer to be in the real \u201cslim fit\u201d category. This is more like Old Navy\u2019s vanity sizing on the slim fit factor. I like my tanks to be pretty form fitting, so that was less than optimal. That said, it\u2019s a great tank for a great price. I love the ringer collar and arm holes.Good buy. Looks slick.",
        "It fits well and looks nice. No tag to cut off on the collar. The medium size is a little snug but the large might be too big. These do shrink a little after washing.",
        "These are nice, slim fitting tank tops for those who like a contoured fit to the body. Color variety is nice and material is soft.However, these tank tops are all **100% COTTON!!! Not 60%, as advertised.** The fit was perfect when I tried the XS on, and I know 60% cotton usually doesn't shrink significantly. Well, after a single wash/dry this became a skinny fit tank top and that's when I noticed the tag says 100% cotton. I checked other colors I purchased and saw the same, all 100% cotton.The shrink really was most noticeable along the contours (under the arm and pectoral area, especially if you are slim and muscular), not so much change to the length. If it was 90-95% cotton and 5-10% elastane, I don't think this would matter at all. However, since there's no stretch, you really better look fit if you want to wear it after a wash or otherwise go with a size up. Would've given 5 stars if it had some elastane to give the material some give with the shrunken \"skinny fit.\"They at least could have pre-washed it if 100% cotton, or better yet - advertise the product correctly.",
        "It's like a tank top from yesteryear. The top strip at the shoulder is the correct width, not too small like most tank tops. Slim-fit is accurate. If you're large I'm not sure how this would work for you. Essentials products always seem to be how people want them and reasonably priced.",
        "It is really soft and particularly cotton which absorbs sweat during exercise.",

        "It's a light piece that makes a good outwear. There's a big difference between this and a sweaty, intchy all-synthetic rain/wind blocker. Very pleased with purchase.",
        "I bought this jacket mainly for rainy days. I had sizing issues that made me return my first order (Medium) and opted for a size Small. The women\u2019s jacket, in the same style, was sold out in the color black so I tried my chances with the men\u2019s version. So maybe that\u2019s why the sizing was off for me because I\u2019m a woman. My measurements are 36C, 26 waist & 5\u20190\u201d. I normally wear a small or medium in women\u2019s tops/outerwear. And the small is a bit baggy. I have plenty of room for layering at least two sweaters and a tank top underneath the jacket. When first wearing it, it was huge, looked like the jacket was swallowing me, but then I adjusted the bottom portion where the string is and tightened the hip part. That made it slightly better. I washed and air dried the jacket and now it seems like it\u2019s a good fit for my body. However, the arms are still baggy but I don\u2019t mind. Idk if the jacket shrunk but it looks ok now. (I wash my clothes with warm water, I hung up the jacket to dry) The jacket ends slightly below my butt but if I move a lot or raise my arms, the jacket will also raise and reveal my butt and front. Just putting that out there for anyone who\u2019s planning to wear leggings with the jacket and possibly has camel toe lol. The jacket shields the rain and keeps me warm. The front pockets are a nice size. I just stick my hands or phone in there whenever I\u2019m walking around. The hood part is also a nice size. I personally think I have a big head and this hood covers it well. One flaw would be that the \u2018cotton\u2019 (not sure if it is cotton), lining in the inside sheds or transfers to my shirt sometimes. It\u2019s very noticeable when i\u2019m wearing black. Overall, I\u2019m satisfied and would say the jacket was well worth the price. Just a suggestion, there should be an XS (:",
        "Love love love this jacket. Warmer than you\u2019d think. Light weight. True to size. My fave. Will buy again.",
        "This jacket is great and really is waterproof. I do say order a couple of different sizes to try one. I noticed sizes vary.",
        "Warm, comfortable, waterproof, I really like the Velcro pocket, and it looks great! This color was at a great value price too!",
        "This jacket is very lightweight, windproof, water-resistant, and warm!  AT 50 degrees F, I wear only a tee shirt underneath and it is very comfortable.  The front handwarmer pouch holds gloves and a stocking cap.  There is also a very roomy second pouch that holds a 20 oz water bottle, cell phone, keys etc.  The hood and waistline have adjustable pull strings to keep out drafts.  The fit may be just slightly snug depending on what you wear underneath and the amount of arm motion (golf e.g.) you desire.  I'm 5'10\", 165 lbs and the large fits fine if I don't wear bulky clothing underneath.",
        "Nice windbreaker with a thin liner. Was perfect for fall. Whenever I wear it I look like I am ready to spontaneously coach a kids football game.",
        "I would have liked thicker nylon but the full-coverage cotton lining sort of makes up for it.  This is NOT something I would do rough work in, as it would be destroyed in short order.  I'll use it for getting groceries in the rain.  I'm 5'-8\" and 150 lbs so I'm always on the border between a small and a medium.  I picked the small this time and I'm glad I did.  The small fits perfectly if you like a trim fit, else get the medium.  The cotton lining can be sort of grabby depending on what you're wearing underneath, requiring some patience to get it on.",
        "Buen precio, calidad tama\u00f1o",
        "Liking it so much that I'm ordering another one but a different color. I weight 250lbs and XXL is a perfect fit. Someone same weight but with a beer belly may need one size larger (if they have it).",
        "I was skeptical. ven when I got the package, it was very light and I thought it was going to be a cheap and useless. But I am pleasantly surprised! The quality is easily worth $45. It's exactly what I was looking for. The inner layer is soft and very warm even though it doesn't feel thicker than a tshirt. It's about 10 degrees celcius and I am pretty sure I will be wearing it up to -10 celcius. It's wind proof, keeps you warm. Incredible bargin.",
        "Although I have not worn it a huge number of times yet, I really like the quality of this windbreaker. The men's S is a little bigger than expected but I don't mind it being a bit oversized. It does a good job protecting against the east coast rain, even though it claims to only be water resistant not water proof. Great simple jacket.",

The material's well made, not as soft as 32 Degrees, but soft enough and does wick moisture.  I only have two complaints:1.  The neck collar is too small, such that when I pull it out over my head, it remove my Jabra 7 earbuds (which are flushed in my ears) too.  Took one star for this.2.  No navy color available :(",
        "These were under 6 dollars! The fit is great for a workout shirt. Washes easily, doesn't wrinkle no matter how you store it. I have several and similar to most of the Amazon Essential products, they are well made and I believe will last over the years.",
        "It's a good shirt, but I didn't like the length. Also, poor quality control as arrived with a hole in one armpit. If you buy, make sure to examine it.",
        "I used to wear primarily 100% cotton t-shirts.  I wanted to get one of those new high performance t-shirts that are light weight and wick the moisture away from the body and breath well to keep me cool.  These high performance t-shits are usually made from polyester, however I have discovered that all polyester fabrics are not the same.  In fact that is probably more variation in the polyester fabrics than there are different weight and types of cotton.  This makes buying a good high performance t-shirt challenging.  In order to order to find one that worked for me I bought several and here is the results of my research:Denali Performance Men\u2019s UPF 50+ ProtectUV Short Sleeve T-Shirt - Large Green- I am keeping this one but it tends to be a bit on the warm side.  Not a good at breathing as the others.  OK for cooler weather.DRIEQUIP Men's Short Sleeve Moisture Wicking T-Shirt-ForestGreenHeather-L- This one was the worst of the 6.  The fabric was prickly and felt warm when wearing it.  It got returned.Pretchic Men's UV Sun Protection UPF 50+ Short Sleeve Sports T Shirt Grey L- This shirt was tied for best with the Amazon Essentials t-shirt.  It feels good to the skin, is light weight, and breaths well.  I plan to buy more.Amazon Essentials Men's Tech Stretch Short-Sleeve Performance T-Shirt, navy heather, Large- This shirt was tied for best with the Pretchic t-shirt.  It feels good to the skin, is light weight, and breaths well.  I plan to buy more.BALEAF Men's Quick Dry Short Sleeve T-Shirt Running Workout Shirts Heather Red Size L- This t-shirt has a shinny finish on the fabric and was the most \u201cdressy\u201d of all the t-shirts tested.  It looks nice but is not as good at breathing as Amazon Essentials Men\u2019s Tech Short-Sleeve Performance t-shirt or Pretchic Men's UV Sun Protection UPF 50+ Short Sleeve Sports T Shirt.Hanes Men's Cool Dri UPF 50 Moisture Wicking T-Shirt, Maroon, Large- I am keeping this one but it tends to be a bit on the warm side.  Not a good at breathing as the others.  OK for cooler weather.",
        "I previously purchased a Russell shirt that was 95% poly and 5% spandex.  I bought is so long ago that it is no longer available.  It is the most comfortable workout/yard work shirt that I own and have been searching for something with a similar material.  I finally found these from Amazon Essentials and am extremely happy with the product.  Similar to most of the Amazon Essential products, they are well made and will hopefully last for years to come.  Highly recommend!",
        "Note the part about the \"slim fit\", which I did not see. I'm 5'8\" and 185. Mine is a large, my normal size, and it is a little too tight. I like my T's to be a little loose. Everything else is fine.",
        "Bought this for my husband and he was pleased with the fit. The only comment he made was that it does fit a little on the small size. Washes well and keeps its shape and size.",
        "Despu\u00e9s de a\u00f1os de uso sigue siendo funcional, es c\u00f3moda, fresca y ligera. A pesar del uso no se ha deformado. El ajuste es muy adecuado.Sin duda un producto que vale la pena volver a comprar",
        "I ordered 2 T-shirts, navy & burgundy, the fit was good, loose fitting as opposed to figure-hugging, which is not what you need when you carry a wide load, like myself.  I have found the T-shirt to be soft to touch, and feel, I wore it for 2 days on the trot, pulled it off, threw it in the corner and then picked it up gave it a shake and put it back on without a crease.  The T-shirt is very soft to the touch, and feel and has a lovely sheen.",

        "I bought these for my husband for Christmas. He usually wears the Nike sweats that look identical, but he's officially been converted to Under Armour. They're comfortable, warm, fit well (including length, he's 6'3\"), and the fabric is just the right thickness to wear while working out but not overheat. The pockets are deep enough to keep your items secure while walking/running. The back pocket is real and secured with a metal snap. The drawstrings don't retract into the waistband. You can tell a lot of thought went into this product's design.",
        "I bought these for my husband who is 6 foot and 240 pounds. He likes his sweats baggy and wears an XL in other brands, but I size up to XXL in Under Armor because they are a slimmer cut. These sweats are soft, comfortable, good quality, and fit well. I got them in black, dark gray, and navy blue and they all look great.",
        "Great fit and very comfortable to wear around the house or out for a walk. My legs stay warm but not uncomfortable during winter walks. Have to watch for deals because the price is way too much. Good quality material but paying over $30 is ridiculous.",

        "The fit is true to size, the quality and material are great. Super soft inside. Only got 1 pair, but now that I've sean and worn them im gonna buy a few more colors. The price tag on them was far more than I paid on Amazon. Made me feel like I got a good deal.",
        "Great fit, great color, and good quality. Would but again",
        "My husband has two pair of these pants. He likes them and they wash well. He has one small complaint. He feels that in an effort to make the waistband hold up to a phone in your pocket They have made it a bit too tight for Comfort. He\u2019s an engineer, so this is only his explanation. He also made this complaint after the Christmas eating season so take it with a grain of salt, and a pound of chocolate, and some red wine \u2026.",

        "First off\u2026 I apologize for the marking up of these images as I\u2019m at work while doing this and my supervisor frequents Amazon often and there are four guys that look roughly alike. That being said\u2026I have been looking for a hoodie that is not too heavy but will keep me warm. I live in central Georgia and the weather here fluctuates like crazy here so you never really know what the temperature will be during my overnight shift. I haven\u2019t purchased any \u201cAmazon Essentials\u201d brand of clothing until now and after reading several reviews, it fit the bill. I received my gray hoodie today and boy\u2026 it was exactly what I was looking for and a HUGE thank everyone who completed a review because of them I based my decision on purchasing it (I have since ordered 5 additional colors)!I am 5\u2019 11\u201d in height, weigh 150 and as you can see, I\u2019m slender in structure. I purchased a medium and it fits me perfectly!!! However, my ONLY complaint is that I wish the banding around the arms were a little smaller/tighter due to the length being about 3/4\u201d - 1\u201d longer than I would like BUT I still rated this product 5\u2b50\ufe0f\u2019s mainly for the fit, feel, texture, quality and color. This hoodie is the ONLY one that has a different color draw string and I wish they would have options on the other colors.If you\u2019re looking for a nice base layer brand of clothing I highly suggest getting this bad boy\u2026 You definitely won\u2019t regret it! Thank you Amazon for hooking me up and for the price ($13.50) it\u2019s even better!",
        "Love it and I\u2019m getting more but I will size up. I went with a small (5\u20192, 115 lbs) and it is snug and no way will I be able to layer with it. But I definitely like the softness.",
        "Fits as expected and matched my uggs perfectly!",
        "The Amazon Essentials Hoodie has pleasantly surprised me with its simple yet effective design, making it my go-to choice for just about anything. Its thin and cozy construction strikes a perfect balance, making it an ideal companion for various activities.The coziness factor is where this hoodie truly shines. The material is soft against the skin, providing a comfortable and snug fit. Whether I'm lounging at home, running errands, or heading to the gym, the hoodie is the versatile choice that seamlessly transitions from one activity to another.I don't want to take it off!",
        "I\u2019m a woman but I prefer buying mens hoodies bc the quality seems to be better overall for the price compared to a lot of womens clothes. I work in a refrigerated environment for work so I buy a lot of hoodies online, especially when it\u2019s out of season in the store. I wanted something a little more lightweight than usual and this was perfect. Sometimes the band at the hips is tight so it makes the hoodie ride up, despite how large it is\u2026 but for this hoodie it was perfect. I\u2019m 5\u20195\u201d, usually wear a size medium womens or size 8 for reference. I bought a large (for a loose fit even after it\u2019s been in the dryer) and it was comfortably baggy and hit a little below the hips. I can see how this hoodie would be too short in the torso if you were much taller. Very nice and soft hoodie and I would recommend sizing up (like I did) if you want a baggy fit because it seems to be a more fitted style.",
        "I purchased two of these in size Large. Unfortunately, the fit is just too awkward. The arms and chest fit as expected but they are very short.  I'm 5'10\" 170lbs.  The bottom barley covers my waistline.  Otherwise, they would make a great lightweight hoodie.",
        "I'm a woman, I ordered a large.  Probably could have done medium, here I have a midweight longsleeve underneath and still lots of room.  I'm a 38 D and get tired of shirts being tight in the bust.  Nice flatlock stiching around generous kangaroo pocket.  NO pinching on the bottom band, and at 5'7 it is plenty long.  I love it!  If it had raglan sleeves it would be my dream hoodie.",
        "Love the vibrant color, feel, and light weight nature. Great for layering. True to size. Washes without piling.",
        "I love the French terry. It washes so well and isn\u2019t too hot or plastic.",
        "Me atrevo a decir que usan medidas estandarizadas, ya que he visto prendas similares en tiendas f\u00edsicas y de talla superior a la especificada y comparadas con esta parecen ser dos tallas mas chica.",
        "great fit, nice regular styled hoodie with no markings or graphics. Great for 18-21 degree weather, more than that I would say wear something lighter.  This is quite good for a light chill day, where I need a little warmth but not like fleece warmth, but can be easily layered.  perfect for fall weather.  doesn't catch lint easily, Love this hoodie, would recommend and purchase it again.",
        "The garment was 100% as expected. Good fit and excellent material.",
        "Achet\u00e9 il y a tr\u00e8s longtemps et beaucoup utilis\u00e9 : il est toujours en parfait \u00e9tat !Belle apparence, tiens bien les lavages et taille correctement.Attention : le tissu est fin et ne tient pas tr\u00e8s chaud. Je l'utilise en toute saison sans souci malgr\u00e9 tout."

This shirt is perfect! It's not too wide and it actually fits in the length! I'm glad more name brands are realizing that men need size Tall. We wore for family pictures and it looked great. We added a few more colors since this purchase for his work meetings!",
        "Washes well and very comfortable.",
        "I have bought over 20 of these shirts, they do last but I used them for work, I\u2019m a company owner who sometimes still has to be on my tools, this shirts make me look professional and at the same time take a beating when I have to get the work done.",
        "The Shirt is incredibly Comfortable. The material is very slick and doesn\u2019t stick your skin if you are sweating. I have washed the shirt a dozen times already and its not losing any color or shape. The Collar is still perfect after 12 wash cycles and I haven\u2019t had to iron the shirt one time. It seems to bounce right back to its original form every time. It is a breathable fabric and the wind passes through it fairly easily, so when its hot outside but there\u2019s a light breeze you stay very cool. I bought one and wore it for a week and washed it every day, and as previously stated it doesn\u2019t lose any of its form, but in addition it didn\u2019t seem to shrink at all when i washed it. I am extremely happy with these shirts and I have 4 different style \u201ccarhartt\u201d shirts that don\u2019t even get close in comfort or fit, the carhart shirts lose their fit and the collars get floppy and require constant ironing. I bought 5 more of these shirts and I couldn\u2019t be happier. I Highly recommend these shirts to anyone and everyone. Buy it and you wont be disappointed, in fact you\u2019ll be very impressed.",
        "Love the shirts look nice great to wear! The problem is the sizing honestly we sent back 4 if this color 4 of another color and 2-3 times for 2 other colors. Sizes are all over the place. Ordered the exact same size every time and they all fit different....too small too big too short too long you name it. Took so many times of sending back to eventually get one that fit correctly it was silly!! Amazon and Ariat were good about the returns but somewhat ridiculous to have to do that to get one that fit.",

Words to describe?  Comfortable, soft, warm, flexible but sturdy, properly shaped.  Heck, I may wear it to the store.  Great product.",

        "My pet peeve is that none of these type of pants have a front opening for men.I bought these to replace pajama pants, not to work out.They are thicker than pajama material. So, it should last longer. No tearing or thinning of the material.They are comfortable.I bought XL, same size as my pajama pants. However, these are wider than my pajama pants, so it wasn't a snug fit. I had to use the string to insure that it doesn't fall down.After washing the extra width shrunk. Now it is a perfect fit without tying the string.I ordered another pair. I will measure the difference before and after washing.My wife said the black color was a nicer look.",
        "I'm a 5' 11\" woman and have trouble finding pants that are long enough. I bought these on a whim because they were much cheaper than the women's version. Now I will never buy the women's version again. These are a good weight. Not too thin, not too thick and don't make me sweat. They're long enough and so so comfy! They also don't seem cut too small in the hips and thighs, which can be an issue with men's clothing on my body.I will say, size down one size from your regular women's size. For example, if you wear a large in women's, get a medium in these pants. I got a large and they are way too big. However, they're so comfortable, I don't really mind that. Otherwise, I'm very pleased!!",
        "You cant go wrong. Loose cuffed around the ankles, front pockets along with a back pocket. My go-to for lazy days, and sleeping. Very comfortable and the quality is great for the price.",
        "Bought as gift. Recipient likes them. They are soft and comfortable. They fit well. Not much shrinkage after laundering. I would recommend them for men or women. I think he bought me the same kind as a gift. I love mine too.",
        "The fit is excellent for me, right on size. The fabric is soft and heavyweight, and the quality appears to be high; time and mileage will tell. I definitely recommend these.",
        "I really like the thickness of these pants, not too thick but not too thin.The problem is that they are definately on the bigger size which is interesting as some reviews say they run small. I saw someone mention that the inseam length of a large is 29\" but i bought a medium and it's also 29\".If you want the pants to fit the shape like the photos advertised above then it might be best to buy them smaller. I bought a large (and they are bigger than the usual sweatpants I also get in a large) and they fit but they are really baggy. I then bought a medium and they are still really really baggy. Ofcourse you can look at the measurements beforehand but definately keep in mind of the sizes if you ever want to buy this and how you want it to look.",
        "Son de buena calidad y c\u00f3modos",
        "I am a six foot tall female - I bought the ladies version in Large and men's in Medium. These men's pants are a great value, great features and very comfy. These ones have great pockets (ladies version had none), a great waist band, and they're still a bit short on me but I have very long legs so that is normal. I have wide hips, and of course the problem with ladies wearing men's clothing is men are smaller in the hip department but I can get there over my hips easily and then the sit nice and high for a high waisted look/feel which I love.",

        "The Blue Lacoste Men's Short Sleeve Polo is the epitome of timeless style and effortless sophistication. As soon as I slipped it on, I felt like I was ready to stroll the streets of Paris with an air of casual elegance. The fit was just right, hugging my torso in all the right places, and the short sleeves added a touch of laid-back charm.The attention to detail in this polo is impeccable. The iconic crocodile emblem embroidered on the chest is a subtle yet powerful statement of quality and craftsmanship. The rich blue hue is both classic and modern, making it a versatile piece that can be dressed up or down for any occasion.The fabric is a dream to wear, soft against the skin, and surprisingly breathable. I've worn it on warm summer days, and it kept me cool and comfortable throughout the day. The quality is evident in every stitch, and I can tell this polo will be a staple in my wardrobe for years to come.Whether you're sipping cocktails at a rooftop bar or having a casual day out with friends, the Blue Lacoste Men's Short Sleeve Polo will elevate your style game to a whole new level. It's a true wardrobe essential that combines sophistication with comfort - a winning combination in my book!",
        "It gets softer with every wash. Looks great and fits amazing. Love the material. So soft. A little pricey but worth it.",
        "Perfect for these active outfitting especially in hot climates. Looks good, feels good.",
        "As a long time user of Lacoste shirts, this shirt is not the usual material I am used to. It is is like a combination of dri-fit and cotton, softer and more airy. As a person living in the tropics, shirt is well suited for the usual hot/warm weather. Time will tell if material will last like the traditional materials used by Lacoste.",
        "Love the product but at 6'5 275, it was a bit too small",
        "This was the best polo I have purchased for my son ever! Soft with a perfect fit and looked as it were made for him! He loved the color!",
        "The quality was \ud83d\udc4d",
        "Having never used a dryer or washed outside of tag recommendations, as well as using the delicate cycle, the two Lacoste polos I purchased shrank considerably that they are no longer wearable. They are soft, not thick polos, but if you are looking for long term use, these are designed to shrink, your money. Look online used first before you buy and see what the number one issue is, compare the polo length of used polos to the new one you are set to buy and decide from there. Double the price of a regular polo size to buy a long size. Hmmm. Lacoste Customer service was no help at all.",

        "I really like these shirts. I actually bought another one after my first lived up to expectations.When I first bought it I was worried that it would shrink, seeing as how it said on the tag not to tumble dry. I was like, forget that and dried it anyway on medium. It did shrink a tiny bit in length but it is still the perfect length for me to wear. I can still tuck it in and not have it constantly coming untucked. Also, looks great with some chino shorts untucked. Sleeves come about halfway down my biceps and is more of a slim fit then relaxed fit.Nice soft cotton, that feels great while wearing. After a number of washes (and tumble dries) collar still looks perfect and no fraying or lose threads.Great collared shirt for office work or just outside untucked on a nice summer day if you can get past the price. Tag says made in Peru which is a lot better than China in my book as well which is also a plus.",

These are perfect size and comfortable.  This is the second pair I\u2019ve purchased and they are holding up well after several months of use and washings.

I recall speedo is good and long lasting with repeated chlorine pool cycles even with rinsing out/air drying after each use.  They do dry quickly.

I have big legs.These shorts don't have pockets or a pretty bow to tie for looks on the outside.  They go down mid thigh and I need to hike them when stretching my inner thigh.For swimming they have been great.  The shorts tie and the string is on the inside, they don't restrict my movement, and they create a bit of drag.  I don't have any issues with the inner lining, I wear spandex underneath.These are swim trunks so I have yet to wash them.  Putting them in the spin then then hanging them up overnight is more than enough to keep them in serviceable.",

If you're more into CKs, then these won't be your top choice.  If you're looking for an upgrade from FTL, Hanes, etc. then you'll be quite happy.

I'm 6' tall and about 180lbs, the leg holes are too small for me, its kinda tight on the legs but I'm only a 32/33 waist, so the Large would be too big for me.

I thought maybe they had sorted out the issues they were having, or people were being picky, but the originals and these are totally different types of shirts.The fabric on the new ones is very clingy/slinky and you can see the texture of your skin through it. The heathering looks weird, like little tiger stripes. The neck hole is way too small for an XL so it feels like it's choking me and it makes my head look small compared to my body, or makes my shoulders/torso look hulking. The shoulder is cut too wide so it starts several inches down my arm. It looks bad and feels bad.I ordered the tri-black in this listing and the coffee in a related tri-blend listing (it's impossible to keep track of all the listings). The black is a nice dark color but the tri-coffee is a totally different color than the coffee I bought before. It's almost yellow. I don't like it at all.Bella & Canvas tri-blend shirts are better.

I like colors though. I know you're thinking but they cost more, but sometimes you get what you pay for and I definitely feel like I got my money's worth.---and I'll tell ya, I'm kinda cheap.",
        "These socks are the best!  I switched over from Nike socks to the Volcum socks.  I am glad I did!  1. These socks are very comfortable!  2.  They are the perfect thickness!  3.  I have had these several months now, wear them every day and still feels like the day I got them!  I highly recommend these socks! Well worth the money!",

What a fortituous discovery. Volcom make great athletic socks.  I have tried lots of competing products, but keep buying these even though I couldn't be farther from the target skate/snow boarder demographic.  They're a good value, too.",
        "You can tell the material volcom used in these socks are high quality. The reinforced toe seems tough but super soft. These crew socks are also the perfect length for me, I\u2019m 6\u20192\u201d and the sit just below the calf. They\u2019re also pretty warm for cooler climates which is nice since I just moved to NC.",

Has the phrase TRUE TO THIS stitched on the inside of the cuff, and VOLCOM on the left and right sides of the foot making it easy to tell which ones are L or R and keep the pairs together.  Good quality socks...they stay snug on my calf all day and feel very comfortable.",

My large phone bounces around in the pocket and sometimes the pocket comes out from underneath the shorts.

You have to do the full knot.I guess I've gotten used to a cell phone pocket in front or back, so I'll have to stick with running shorts or my flipbelt from now on.",
        "Got these to replace the Under Armor shorts I\u2019d worn out. These are even better. People who\u2019ve complained about the inner lining are not familiar with athletic shorts for men! The lining is a standard part of this kind of sportswear and does not get in the way.Fits as you\u2019d expect so order the size you\u2019d normally get.",

        "I have a pair of these socks that are at least 3 decades old. I dug em out to keep these old 12EEEE feet warm around the house this cold weather. So perfectly warm I ordered two pair hoping the new ones are the same. A few new materials like spandex, but they\u2019re just as nice and warm.",
        "My husband is a logger, working year-round in the woods. During the summer months, he's comfortable with the \"Fox River Wick Dry Northwest Extra-Heavyweight Over-the-Calf Boot Socks, 7587\". But come the other wet and cold fall, winter, and spring in the Pacific Northwest, these \"Fox River Outdoor Sox Mid Calf Sock for Men Thermal Boot Socks\" are the only thing worth wearing. He's tried socks from REI, Bass Pro Shops, Carharrt, and so many other places and NONE of them are worth wearing after a few washes (stiff, shrunken to fit the dog, uncomfortable, lack of padding, etc.). The Fox River Thermal Boot Socks are mainly wool but with a few other fibers blended in to keep them soft, wash after wash, and comfortable. My husband's feet stay warm through some of the wettest and moderately cold weather around, hunting in Eastern Oregon (lots of snow and cold) and Northern Arizona (dry cold), and working long hours in the Oregon Coast Range (wet, wet, and more wet). They are thick enough to be well padded but no too thick for his work and hunting boots and they hold up well.The only cons for the sock are what others have mentioned. This isn't the sock it used to be:-  less wool content than in the past-  not as thickly padded in heel and bottom of the foot as before-  not quite as sturdy- my main problems have become a \"run\" in the knitted sock, usually right under the bottom blue band or an actual hole developing in the heel or toe area in less than a year.That said, I just bought 4 pair here and will be buying another 4 tonight. Still the best I can find for the job!",
        "I am sooo happy I found these. Just finished a 7 day job installing hundreds of fixtures on a multi family 3 story complex. I didn't have any foot issues. Non! not once! never even thought about it!I noticed this pair does go over the calf too. I love them!Previous review,I have searched and searched for these. I have Carhart, Thorlo, Red Head and these. Red wing carried them for awhile at 29.00!!!They are the most comfortable sock I have owned. Carhart and Red head are 2nd. Thorlo 3rd.I've have several Carhart cold winter Artic. They do what they say but aren't as comfortable and don't stay up when wearing shoes or short boots.Thorlo easily has the best built sock. Do these things ever give in?! The problem I have with them is they are tight and I mean tight. This leads to poor circulation and as everyone knows thats the most important thing when it comes to warm feet and comfort. Unless you are on the move and I mean alot your feet are going to get cold.My feet hurt when I get home at the end of day wearing the Thorlos.I've had this pair of white gray with black and red strips for years and I've spent hundreds trying other brands but nothing can beat these.They stay up so you can wear them with anything.Hands down they are warmer than any others I've tried.Comfort is the reason I kept looking for them for so long.The strange thing is they don't appear any thicker than others but they cushion so well and for the whole day or two!They have last me for years.Age 50+I'm on ladder all day and walking.I wear them with sneakers and Logger Boots.I recommend them for everyone. Especially if you have bad feet. These will keep you going.The only pick on them is they pill a little bit ( so do the others). It could be how I treat them. I have worn them for multiple days and just throw them in with all my work clothes and wash everything together. Dry them in dryer etc.If you try these and feel there are better ones out there let us know.Good Luck and happy feet folksMatt",

        "Update- 11/2021 when I ordered more-description says 3 pairs only received 1 pairMy husband has worn these socks for years & years.  They are the warmest socks we have ever found for him because of the higher wool content. He likes them also because they stay up & are higher on his leg than his work boots.  I've found if you wash them in cold water, in a garment bag & hang dry they last a lot longer. The only complaint we have is they seem to wear out in the heel much much faster than they used to.

        "I wore boxers for years but started having pain where you do not want to have pain. Did some research and concluded more support was needed, but I do not like the constrictive nature of briefs. Figured this was a good middle ground, bought hanes because I had been wearing their undershirts for a while and liked them. No research at all. Medium based on size chart for a 32 waist. These were weird at first, felt too small but quickly got used to it and they became a daily driver. Bought another 6 a month later. They are supportive where needed but not tight. Some extra room in the front is a good thing. Material is breathable, not smooth but not coarse. No rolling waistbands, riding up or down, chafing, any of that nonsense. No center seam and has a functional fly. I do not ever think about them, similar to how I always wear glasses but never think about them. However, in a couple pairs the elastic started to break down and smell so strong they're unwearable. Because of that I started researching. After trying some other stuff and being disappointed, and scared away from many others by some crazy reviews, I will be buying more of these. I still got about 8 pairs going strong and the others lasted a year and a half at least. So consider if you wear each pair once a week, worst case scenario you're going to get 75 wears and washes of each pair, making this quite a good deal.",
        "Seem to be good quality, fit is good.Coming from a mesh-type boxer brief these feel very warm to me.They'll go in the back of the dresser until winter.",
        "And they are very durable.",
        "Wrestled with different styles even within the same brand. These are very comfortable and have a longer length that helps with someone like myself that has a longer waste line and torso. I also like the fact that they are all cotton. IMHO nothing beats cotton. No matter what gimmick the product makers come up with for their non-cotton lines, Cotton breathes better and is cooler so less prone to sweat than in the polyester weaves.",
        "Better quality than most underware.",
        "TARGET HAS THEM FOR ABOUT HALF AS MUCH AS AMAZON. I just got a 6-pack for 15 bucks on Target. Sorry amazon. People are buying Hanes it's because they can't afford Calvin Klein. So it makes sense I steer people to where they can get em cheaper.For the past 18 years I've been wearing Calvin Klein boxer briefs exclusively. Literally. Calvin Klein boxer briefs last practically forever and I've been wearing the same 18-20 pairs for 18 whopping years. They're nearly indestructible. But over the past few months they've been coming apart at the legs so I decided it was time to get new undies. Throw em all out and start anew. But I can't afford CK anymore. So I went with Hanes. And I gotta say, they are great! Sure, they aren't as soft or as thick as the CKs, but these are really well made, breathe really well, and have longer legs than the CKs which I didn't realize was an important factor for me but turns out longer legs are superior! And yes, THEY DO SHRINK. But they don't shrink to being child size. They shrink, but you put them on and the stretch out to how they were for the most part. Still a bit smaller, but nothing drastic. I love them.",

        "Just ordered these after an expensive pair of sport pants wore out.  These are exactly what I was looking for...at a fraction of the price.  These pants are lightweight, comfortable, and loose fitting.  These are great lounge pants as well as suitable for wearing to run errands.  Yes, these are nice.",
        "I love these pants! I\u2019m always hot and these are nice and lightweight so I\u2019m not overheating. They do run slightly long though.",
        "Ok for what we used them for..3rd time buying and after the 1st buy 2 years ago string around the waist stitching came undone....",
        "Fit true to size. Exceptional quality of Hanes. Comfortable.  Good look!",
        "These pants are very light and comfortable, however they're crazy long on the inseam. I'm 6' tall and the xl was a solid 6+ inches too long of an inseam for me. They'll be fine for me around the house, but not much else.",
        "Buying clothes online can be hit or miss.  These pants are a hit.  Decent quality for the money and a good fit.",
        "TL;DR - insanely comfortable pants well-suited to wear around the house and outdoors as long as it isn\u2019t too cold; they are extremely thin and won\u2019t offer much warmth but I cannot say anything negative about this purchase; worth buying a backup pair for when I wear the . . .  pants . . .off of these pants!One evening last month I put on a pair of warmup pants \u2014 THE warmup pants, I had no other \u2014 and realized they weren\u2019t all that new when Pope JPII was alive, and the elasticity was gone completely, and there was too much pant material for my frame, and maybe I should retire these.They were fairly heavy, but I live in a sub-tropical climate and hardly ever need anything so heavy.So I bought these because they were rated well and inexpensive compared to other known brands and I was not going to be hassled by the thousands of off-brand options, all of which I regard as a gamble at best and a hassle at worstI am very pleased with my purchase. For context, I am 6\u20190\u201d, between 160 and 165 lbs depending on the day, and could reasonably be described as long-legged but not drastically so.Size: I bought medium, and they fit me perfectly. Take my height and weight into account in deciding your size. They even might run a hair long, but that could be due to how they sit at my waist.Style: I wear these in and around the house, and need only impress my dog, so these were simple and basic enough that I didn't much care how they look, but the photos are accurate.Comfort: I have achieved maximum comfort permitted by natural pants law, and wear these at all times until I go out during the day, and from after I get home and dress down.Material: The material is very thin and lightweight. I don\u2019t think I would want to be outdoors in temperatures below 60\u00b0 F for long in these, but that\u2019s not of much concern to me. If you have cooler temperatures often enough  and want something to wear outside, this is not the right option.If this description matches your need, you cannot go wrong with these!",
        "First off, these are great breathable lightweight pants. They are stretchy and they are not a skinny pants tight fit, little more on the loose side, which I prefer. The bottom of the pants by the ankles are open and does not have an elastic cuff. That being said, if you are on the shorter side but bigger in build(like myself), these pants will be way too long to wear without it completely just dragging on the ground and looking ridiculous. In order for someone with a shorter but big build to wear these, the pants would most likely need to be hemmed. Others then that, the sizing as far as waist/hips is on point. The length could be shorter for my preferences but for people that aren\u2019t exactly short, the length might be perfect.",
        "XL was too big & too long but it came with a draw string, replaced with L but that one didn't have a draw string, Trying again for another size L...lets hope it has a draw string, hemming will be required. Otherwise ultra light weight and comfortable.",
        "Compr\u00e9 XL, mido 1.72 y peso 111kg, me qued\u00f3 muy bien, solo me qued\u00f3 largo pero lo llev\u00e9 a la sastrer\u00eda y lo ajustaron. Es fresco y c\u00f3modo; la tela es el\u00e1stica y delgada (como una playera) aunque no transl\u00facida. Si es para deporte o uso diario es \u00fatil, si lo quieres para el fr\u00edo no es adecuado.",
        "These are perfect for summer because they are nice and light. I like my bottoms to be loose and baggy to be more comfortable for me. I am 5' 8\" and 200 lbs and I ordered the XL. It is perfect for me with good length too.",
        "Very good pants, fit well",
        "I bought these for my dad. Fit was good, though a little long and he is tall so may need to have them taken up. Not very thick so better weight for Spring and Autumn weather."

        "I recently got my hands on the Merrell Unisex-Adult's Wool Everyday Hiking Socks in the 3 Pair Pack with Cushion Arch, and they've quickly become an essential part of my outdoor gear. These socks provide exceptional comfort with their well-designed cushioning, particularly in the arch area, making long hikes and outdoor activities far more enjoyable. Even in cooler weather, the wool blend in these socks keeps my feet warm without causing overheating, striking a perfect balance between insulation and breathability. Moreover, their durability is impressive; they've proven to be exceptionally resilient even with regular use and washing, showing no signs of wear or thinning. Additionally, these socks stay in place during hikes, ensuring that they don't slide down or bunch up, which is essential for preventing blisters and discomfort. Their unisex design is also convenient, making them suitable for both men and women. While they may be on the pricier side compared to other hiking socks, the quality and performance they deliver make them a worthwhile investment for outdoor enthusiasts. If you enjoy spending time outdoors, I highly recommend giving these Merrell hiking socks a try\u2014they might just become your go-to choice for your outdoor adventures.",
        "Socks are tricky for me, I have sensory issues due to my ADHD/Autism so I need soft, breathable socks but I also need them to keep my feet warm and provide some cushioning between my feet and work boots. It\u2019s a hard line to straddle. Wool is best for warmth and moisture-wicking but often wool or wool blends are extremely scratchy and abrasive to my sensitivities. Cotton just falls apart after short periods due to how active my job is.This are some of the best socks I\u2019ve found, full stop. They\u2019re affordable, plush, and very durable in my situation. They give enough cushion on my pressure points from my boots (heels and upper ridge) so there\u2019s no blistering or rubbing either with a new pair of boots or just from long days in shoes, they keep my feet warm when I\u2019m stuck in coolers at work for 3+ hours at a time, and they\u2019re not restricting or too snug around my ankles or toes. I can even wear them to sleep on cold nights without yanking them off in my sleep. Durability is solid, for me at least. They\u2019ve gotten wet, muddy, absconded with via cats, and other manners of abuse that necessitate heavy cleaning and held up well. No pilling or thinning of the fabric to my eyes as of yet.I wear a US Women\u2019s 9 shoe and bought the S/M size and they fit me perfectly.",
        "They're very soft and pretty thick - great for colder weather (but I'd wear them year-round).",
        "Good fit..warm and comfy",
        "All wool.  Comfortable.  Fit well (I wear a wome's size 8-1/2 shoe).  They're still new, so I can say how they hold up.",
        "Love these socks been buying these for years from Merrel. These socks have high cushion and feel amazing. Great quality and long lasting wash after wash. These socks won\u2019t disappoint!",
        "Great fit, great comfort. So far, they wash and wear well. I would highly recommend!",
        "This is the 2nd time I have ordered these socks. They are incredibly warm, well made and fit my small foot!",
        "Great fit and comfort",
        "Very good product, fit great & good sizing for me, size 11.  They also look as they will last, which is good as they\u2019re not cheap!",
        "These are very warm and they wash well.",
        "Lovely socks, very comfy",
        "Muy comodos y en mi experiencia se me meti\u00f3 un poco de agua al calzado sent\u00eda el agua en el calcet\u00edn pero mi pie estaba seco y calientito"

        "Purchased this for my trip to Norway. I wore this with a few layers underneath and I was very warm. HIGHLY recommend. The windproof and waterproof features were a life saver.",
        "Never had a Helly-Hansen jacket in the past, so this Reine Parka is my first.  Many reviews, so let me address some specific points.Sizing: I am 167 pounds, 5 foot 9 inches, and average build (not portly).  I have slightly short arms, I wear a 40 Short suit jacket.  Most of my Tee shirts are Large (never medium) and yet Amazon recommended Medium for me in this jacket; I reluctantly went with their suggestion.  Voila...perfect fit!  I dislike tight feeling jackets, and this one is not. I even have a down North Face puffy down vest I often wear and I wore it beneath this HH jacket in medium and it still fit fine, not too tight.  It really fits me well at Medium. So, if you are my size, I'd suggest Medium. If you are not my size, at least you know the Amazon size recommendation seems accurate.Warmth: some reviews said it was not warm, and admittedly, when I took it out of the package it is modestly thin in \"puffiness\"...it doesn't feel bulked up like many of my past parkas. Fortunately, it is literally 0 degrees F in Chicago right now, so I wore the jacket with only a tee shirt and jeans outdoors and walked around for 10 minutes. I felt toasty as a mating gull, it was fine.  My legs in jeans were cold, but my torso under this jacket was fine. I like that there is a flap over the YKK front zipper that provides outstanding wind relief, and the neck gusset cinched up nicely to protect my neck.  I did not test the waterproof fabric in rain.Fur on hood is zipper detachable, looks real. Somewhat floppy over face if fully \u201csnorkled\u201d (could have used an internal wire for support), it\u2019s fine when hood is up on head and fur is roller back to face.Pockets: Sweet large pockets, including for gloves, chest pocket for phone, and interior 6-inch mesh pockets on each side of items.Recommended, despite moderately high price. Looks sharp as it has a flattering cut, especially in black.",
        "Very warm. He hated the fake fur, so we took that off. He loves the coat.",
        "I am very pleased with the size and fit of this parka, I ordered an extra large and it fits just right, not too loose or too tight and allows me to layer my clothes underneath. My only complaint is that the hood is not adjustable, so if you were not wearing a helmet, and you don't have a foot tall neck, the hood flops down over your forehead into your line of vision. At this price point, I would expect the hood to be adjustable. It is plenty of warm in 20\u00b0F temperatures without a lot of activity as well. It would also be nice if it had a double zipper because of its length. Overall I am pleased with the jacket, but a couple of small details would make this go from four stars to 5 plus.",
        "This Helly Hansen jacket is amazing - not uber fitted, so you don't wind-up looking like a sausage; also it is definitely a parka, but it is not over-stuffed....not a fan of Climate Change, but with some parkas you are so warm you can't comfortably wear anything underneath other than waffle-weave shirt...if you do manage to stuff a sweater inside some parkas you look like the Michelin Man, the fake collar is  real-looking fur as it can get and this super Helly Hansen Riene Parka came from Lithuania to Vermont in just 3 days.",
        "I have only had the jacket for a week, but it is already my favorite cold weather jacket of all time.  It's warm, comfortable, light, and allows maximum freedom of movement.  And looks good, too.",
        "This is the perfect selection for winter!",
        "For a $320 coat, I'm deeply disappointed.  I really only have had to wear it for 6 weeks now.  But the weather is changing in Wisconsin, and winter is finally here.  I am a teacher and do traffic duty before and after school, and it gets very cold.  I loved the hood because I could have it up and still have good peripheral vision, unlike my old parka.  However, when I was trying to tighten up the hood a little, one of the pull cords snaped.  Now, the hood cannot be tightened, and it greatly reduces the effectiveness and the best feature of the coat.  Even if they replace or fix it, how long is that going to take?  It's going to be in the single digits for highs next week...and I'm not going to have the coat I needed?  That sucks.  Lastly, when it does get really cold (I'd day 10 degrees or below) you need to wear a fleece under the coat.  It's warm...but it's not elite coat warm.Update 11/23:  Still a one star review.  It was 10 degrees this morning and I had to change into a different coat as this one just doesn't have enough fill to keep you warm.  It's ok for 30 degrees and above, but I wouldn't reccommend it for under 20 degrees.",
        "Helly Hansen is an excellent brand, I have had many jackets, the quality,  softness, warmth etc all holds great value, yes the pricing of jackets are costly but it beats being cold.",
        "Muy buena chamarra ! Excelente protecci\u00f3n para el fr\u00edo, he usado otras marcas pero HH es muy buena, la recomiendo",
        "First off, I used to be super warm blooded and didn\u2019t need a super warm coat.  However, the last view years, I\u2019ve aged (considerably it seems) and now I feel the cold.  Really feel the cold.  My knees ache, my elbows ache, my hands\u2026oh my god my hands\u2026my nibbles, well\u2026we don\u2019t need to talk about them.I had a Columbia Turbo down jacket\u2026not warm enough\u2026Canada Goose parka\u2026ok that one was warm enough.  Helly Hansen Ski jacket, didn\u2019t cut it for normal winter wear in Peterborough anymore (still good for winter hiking, snowshoeing).  So I searched all over for the right parka, read reviews, asked the manufacturer questions, and finally settled on the Reine.Happy I did.  It is a pretty warm coat, -10 Celsius, it\u2019s good with just a cotton long sleeve shirt under neath.  I wore it a couple mornings ago walking the dog, -27 Celsius with a HH insulator jacket and a T-shirt, insulated pants, mitts, toque (and boots of course) and I was very comfortable walking the dog.  Probably would have been ok, waiting for a bus, or a bit of ice fishing too.  Not sure I could have lasted all day sitting on a lake in those temperatures though\u2026It\u2019s got a huge insulated hood and a very generous cut.  The arms are well insulated and long enough for me.  I am 5\u20198\u201d 190 lbs.  Chest 42\u201d, pant  waist is 34.  Plenty of room for a sweater or insulator underneath.  Haven\u2019t tested it in the rain, but it\u2019s too warm to wear much above 0 C, anyways.  Pockets are big and snap closed, along with a couple of hand warmer pockets and a hidden chest pocket with zip.It doesn\u2019t have a draft tube or snow skirt around the waist.  If it\u2019s windy I do feel the breeze blow up my back.  That\u2019s probably the biggest flaw and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  With an insulator underneath, it\u2019s not an issue.  The hood is huge and with the faux fur on it flops in front of my face\u2026I\u2019ll likely never use the fur bit\u2026I wear an old navy large, HH medium, MEC medium, Columbia medium for info.Overall, it\u2019s a very warm, decent jacket.",
        "Great warm parka, with lots of pockets",
        "Excellent jacket lightweight but still warm and waterproof. Hiviz strips on the cuffs fold away. Would highly recommend after working in harsh conditions over the Christmas."

        "It\u2019s comfortable, fits and looks well and I like the deepness of the pockets as well as the little pocket for the phone, it avoids it from jumping as I walk.",
        "My husband had a pair of these in another size and I thought I'd give them a try for me. Jackpot: nice fit, deep pockets. mesh pantyliner, quick drying. On the down size : a little too long, next time will try for a 3 inch pair...if none available would buy these again.",
        "These might be my favorite shorts now. They are comfortable light weight and fit well. They are the right shape too so if you have a thinner waist but still have glutes and quads it looks great. Some people are complaining about the pockets but there's an inner pocket that doesn't go all the way to the bottom.",
        "I bought these for everyday wear, not specifically for running or working out. The length is just right at a couple of inches above the knee (I'm 6'-1\" and the shorts are XL). The fabric has some stretch to it and breathes well - I've bought other brands and the fabric has a plastic feel to it, but that's not a problem with these. But I have three minor issues that make this a 4-star review instead of 5 stars:1) The pockets are deep, which is nice when you want to carry a wallet, cell phone, and keys (oh, I wish cargo shorts were still in style!), but the drawback of the deep pockets is that the shorts ride up over the pocket. If I have anything in a pocket, it hangs out the bottom of my shorts when I sit down (see the photo with this review.2) The waistband is 1-1/2 inches wide, something I've never had with other athletic shorts. If the waist is at all snug, this may bother you as it does me, although it's something I get used to after wearing them awhile.3) The inner liner seems to be cut higher on the sides than on other athletic shorts, which tends to pull the liner out of place. Again, not too uncomfortable but I have to fidget with my shorts a lot.I'll continue wearing these, but doubt I'll buy another pair.",
        "I own two pairs of these and they\u2019re great.-strong waistband-great fit-great breathabilityWill be buying another pair soon.",
        "I snagged 2 of the black shorts while they were on sale. My size will vary from small to medium depending on the designer. I opted to try the small for gauging and they seemed to fit just right around hip area but a slight tightness around the waist! I dont have a big butt so I fill these out discreetly without appearing baggy. The material is comfortable (includes liner) with room to stretch depending on your body type. I am definitely going to purchase more now that I have a good idea of the fit and try the medium next round. Overall, Im pleased and would recommend.",
        "These gym shorts are a must-have for anyone hitting the gym. They're super comfortable, allowing full movement during workouts. The fabric is both soft and durable, handling all my activities without wear. The pockets are a convenient bonus. Overall, a solid choice for anyone seeking reliable and comfy workout gear.",
        "I ordered these shorts for my husband in a size medium and was surprised when I opened them to see how small they were and were different on the side. The cut was smaller than pictured (was expecting closer to knee length) and these were not a men's size short. They actually fit my 11 year old son perfectly. The color was probably the only thing close to what was pictured. Overall disappointed for my husband since these were a purchase meant for him but will keep since they ended up fitting my son.",

        "Before trying these, I tried tights from usual suspects, Nike / UA / Puma ... etc, nothing would provide good support while staying comfortable. I tried bigger size and smaller size for these brands to see if its a fit thing .. and realized that its not fit but the design and quality of material that impacts how comfortable and supportive you feel while wearing these. I was glad that I tried these, these are comfortable and stay on when I play pickleball or go out for a run. These provide just the right amount of compression / support without being  uncomfortable. I particularly like how the stitching lands on the top of my knees and provides good support.",
        "I use these to help with circulation and they are fantastic.",
        "I got my first pair of compression leggings a few months ago - a low-cost Under Armour pair - to wear under my knee braces during softball.  A teammate recommended compression leggings with built-in knee braces, and I found these, which were also recommended on numerous Reddit posts.These support my knees really well.  They require frequent adjustment of the crotch, but I think that's just part of wearing compression leggings.  I have short legs and maybe that's why, but they also require that I pull them up pretty regularly so that the knee support sections of the leggings are in the right spot on my knees (instead of my shins).I've worn them when playing softball and riding a stationary bike for 2+ hour workouts, and I feel a huge difference wearing them while working out with no loss of range of motion.",
        "The quality of the tights is excellent.  The sizing is just right.  I am 6\u20198\u201d and 285 and picked the XLL/XLT (I plan on dropping a few pounds \u263a\ufe0f). I have had multiple knee surgeries and walk often with pain.  I have found that the support in the tights is actually more comfortable than knee sleeves.My ONLY complaint so far is that they don\u2019t have pockets for a phone.  In this day and age, why doesn\u2019t EVERY manufacturer just acknowledge that we are tied to our electronics and accommodate that?",
        "These fit me great.  Of course your fit experience will vary.  I wear them running from about 25 degrees to 50 dry, or 60 raining and also do OCR with them.  They are comfortable for biking from about 45-50 degrees to 70.  Below 45 is probably too cold for me for biking in these.  I have similar tights from 2xu and this material is thicker.",
        "As advertised! Let\u2019s just say I have big issues with my right leg. Between medial strains, Achilles tear, bone on bone you name it! Regular braces caused more pain. Soft braces were close but just not enough. I\u2019m super active and don\u2019t want to stop or get surgery. My fear was injuring the other leg so I tried these. I\u2019m super happy with the results, I feel more stable than ever before. My mobility when playing Pickleball is back to normal. I add a soft thick Copper sleeve to the bad knee just to be over protective and I\u2019ve been pain free. I wear these only during playing games and just a sleeve the rest of the time. Very happy to say the least. If this keeps me out of a doctors office I\u2019m a happy camper!",
        "I have tried many running tights and compression pants over the past several years. One of the first I ever bought were from CW-X... And then I went off looking for a cheaper alternative, because I'm not made of money. Some of my other purchases were ok, some didn't maintain their compression, some sagged and wouldn't stay in place. While all of my other purchases were cheaper, many quickly found their way into the donation pile which meant I spent more money looking for the next option. Remember how I'm not made of money? So this purchase makes my third pair of CW-X tights, because investing in good equipment that takes care of you makes sense.So, let's talk about the good and the bad for a second.Good: lots of research has clearly gone into these tights. I'm used to kinesio tape as a means to support body function, and these tights work that same concept right into the fabric. You can feel the difference the moment you put them on. I can't speak to the exact percentage of increased performance, but the difference is something you can feel and that isn't something most pants can claim.Bad: well, let's be honest, these are pricey. Good, but on the high dollar amount is still an obstacle. While a good performance enhancing running tight is awesome it simply isn't necessary for 90% of the runners out there where \"fine\" would work just as well. Unless you compete, or you have some disposable income to toss around you can get away with good options at half the cost. My other, somewhat trivial, complaint is the lack of pockets. There is a rather small pocket much like you find inside a swimsuit, but it isn't real secure and forget carrying much more than a small key. My car keys are too big for the pocket and I don't have large electronic keys like my wife's car has. Many other running shorts and tights have a zippered pocket centered on the back at about the waistline. This option is secure, can be made big enough to carry an ID with you, and really doesn't screw with construction like side pockets since compression is still a goal here. If they added this feature they would be head and shoulders above the closest competition.All that being said, these are my favorite go-to tights for races and days when I need a little extra for a hard run. For that they overcome the couple minor setbacks and get a 5-star rating from me.",
        "These tights did have a positive impact on my tight calves and knee problems, but beyond that, they were an expensive experiment. I'm 6'2 and about 170lbs and found two problems after wearing these on several 10 mile runs:1. Inseam is just too short for a tall skinny person. Pull them up and they are not placed correctly around the knee. Place them correctly around the knee, and they ride low in the crotch.2. The crotch rides fairly low and has a couple seams. First run I didn't wear anything under the tights and had to turn back after a half mile. Too much movement and too many seams, it was going to be disastrous. Since that first run, I've tried compression shorts, which caused the tights to slide down faster, and an under armour athletic supporter which worked ok underneath.Overall, I'm not sure these tights are going to work for me.",
        "I am a women with lymphodema and I have to wear compression capris as part of my prescription, along with prescribed compression stockings and foot gloves.  I was so pleased with the capris that I also bought full length compressions tights.  Because of lymphodema, I have a very distended abdomen (filled with lymphatic liquids) - that takes space and these tights are perfect to accommodate the space required - extremely comfortable , wash very easily with no shrinking and retain their shape and quality.  A little expensive for me, as I do not use these for sports and very very compressed (hard to put on) so at the end of the day, very happy to remove them.  They look good, high quality fabric, and great colors - I bought olive green and black, and some with colored lines throughout the compression areas.  All in all, very very happy with my purchases, fast delivery for some of the ones I ordered.  They seem to carry low inventory so if you find your size, don't wait to buy it.",

        "These sweaters fit perfectly without binding and are unbelievably comfortable. They have a little stretch to them and they are made of a breathable fabric that will allow for some \"wicking\" in hot weather. They are perfect for all casual affairs as well as casual work days -- or they can be used in some sports activities --I cannot believe how versatile they are! I can actually wear these as they are or I can wear them under a casual blazer or sport jacket with a necklace or a cross on a chain.. along with a pair of dark dress denim jeans and plain black sneakers ...I actually wore these to church and everybody commented positively on them. They do not irritate my skin, I absolutely adore these sweaters and I will definitely be recommending them to my friends and associates and I will be buying them again at a future date.  I am totally sold. No complaints whatsoever!  Great product, great service, great price! They are heavier than a tee-shirt and lighter than a regular sweater which is the ideal profile for a sweater for me.",

        "My husband loves these shorts. They are the longer length that he likes, and they\u2019re very lightweight yet durable. I bought them in another color and he has been wearing them nonstop. I will definitely purchase more of this item.",
        "I spend a day at the local mall trying on various board shorts from many brands. They all fit like they were meant for women, I guess this is the new style? My legs would not even fit through the shorts that matched my waist size, and there was no room for my gentlemen parts. I guess I'm getting old...I took a chance and ordered these, they arrived the day before my backpacking trip. I couldn't be happier with them.The fabric dries quick and is tough. I hiked over 30 miles in them with lots of swimming, sitting, and cliff jumping in between. They held up great. The pockets are very useful and the right side pocket contains a lanyard for hooking your keys, etc.For reference, I have an athletic build, 6ft @ 180lbs. My waist is generally between 31 - 32. The fit is perfect. I ordered the 32. There is slight room in the waist, which can be adjusted a little bit with the drawstring. These fit my waist exactly as they should. The length was good too, they sat just a little lower than the middle of my knee. Not too \"gangsta\", yet not as girly as all the stuff I tried at the mall. They look great and the camo pattern is a really good looking black type camo. I'll be buying more of these!",
        "Fit is awesome! Feel is good. Quick dry! comfortable! very happy with them! Yeah!",
        "I mostly like the design of these shorts, and they work fairly well for wakeboarding.  The material is very fast drying, and the fit is good for water sport use.  I also like the fact that it is not necessary to wear compression shorts under these.  One downside is that these can cut into your abdomen when seated if you have them cinched pretty tight (due to the stiff material used for the fly).  I also purchased Xerosposure Brand Street 2 Swim hybrid board shorts from Amazon at the same time I purchased these Quicksilver Shorts.  The \"Street 2 Swim\" shorts were very similar to the Quicksilver version, but actually were approximately 20% cheaper.  The Street 2 Swim shorts have more pockets, and have belt loops so they are a more versatile short to wear off water.  The material on the Quicksilver shorts also has a stiff/slick feel which I do not like as much as the other shorts, and makes it obvious that these are swim wear if you intend to wear them anywhere besides the beach/lake.  The Quicksilver drawstring is outside the waistband (like most board shorts), which makes them a little easier to cinch up tight for watersports, but the internal drawstring on the S2S shorts makes them less conspicuous as swimwear. The Quicksiver shorts are a better straight-up wakeboard short, but for the price and versatility I prefer the S2S version.  The S2S shorts also have a snap button closure on the waistband which is quite handy.  The Quicksilver shorts just have the drawstring and a Velcro fly. (I have also found a similar Valor brand Hybrid board short on Amazon that is considerably cheaper than the Quicksilver version, and has a zipper fly.)  The sizing is pretty true on these shorts - I typically wear a 34 waist in jeans/pants, and the 34 in these fits fine.  Personally, I also like the black/gray camo color pattern, and these do not seem like they are likely to fade.  All in all, these are a really good board short, but I can't justify the additional price paid just for the Quicksilver label on the back.",
        "To my surprise the quality of these trunks felt much better, durable and comfortable compared to the pair I bought from hurley, which was twice the price. I would buy another if they had more color options.",
        "Great so far. Fit perfect",
        "These are exactly has described but do run small.",
        "My husband is very tall and these swim trunks are a good length for him.  The color is good and they dried in a reasonable amount of time.  He rates these trunks at three stars because there isn't any lining which means he may have to wear briefs with the trunks.  Also the material is thin and feels like they won't last long.",

        "This is my second of these jackets. The first has been worn a lot over the last couple of years and still functions as it should and looks great. My only reason for buying a new one was that my son has started to wear the old one! Good quality jacket - worth the money.",

        "I recently purchased this jacket for a holiday on the North Wales coast,the idea being to cover all weather conditions with one garment.Having previously purchased Craghoppers  jackets with an Aqua Dry membrane,I had high expectations of  the functionality of this GORE-TEX one!!Using the interactive zips,i attached a Craghoppers fleece layer(purchased separately)to the outer shell to provide even more functionality.As well as the GORE-TEX Performance Shell fabric's obvious high quality manufacture and waterproof/breathable qualities,I was amazed how light and comfortable the garment was even after the fleece mid layer was added.The adjustable waist,hem and cuffs add  customisable extra comfort against even the most extreme weather conditions and the roll-away hood with wire was roomy without being oversized,easily allowing for headgear to be worn comfortably  and securely without sacrificing  protection and the brushed chin guard was a huge improvement on my previous jackets!!The only downside was the lack of an internal or external dedicated mobile phone/key pocket,which was surprising at worst,but was easily compensated for using the sizable map pocket!!This jacket,with all its features and functionality built -in,was an excellent purchase at an amazing price and should last for years with appropriate care and attention to the manufacturers care instructions!!"

Waist has a very comfortable give with a unique stretch design that's stays in place without need for belt. Soft,comfortable and very quiet.

The waist has an adjustable Velcro tab on each side, so you can adjust them to your comfort. I have a 30 inch inseam and the pants wear a little long on me.

        "Pants would of been fine except the back right pocked was stitched partially shut. Looks like the inner pocket material was uneven / folded when the operator ran the reinforcement stich. I.E. Quality control is questionable.Also, I'm glad that I've read other reviews and decided go with the  Medium for my 36\" waist (sizing chart specifies that a 36 inch waist should be a large). Medium fits perfectly for a 36 inch waist, a large would of been too big.I gave it a 2 because despite this single manufacturing defect all other stiches seem ok. I'm ok with a needle and this is certainly repairable (cut the old stich and run a new *straight* stich). However, If you decide to buy these, make sure you inspect yours on arrival.Update - 2 days later:*************************I'm sending these back. Discovered far too many untied loose ends and one more 'rushed' stitch.  The hefty price must be for the camo pattern and/or stock material (which is nice) because it's certainly not for quality. No way these will last a season of heavy (outdoor) use (without constant repair)."

        "I love these jeans because they\u2019re soft and comfortable while also stylish. I feel like the picture of these jeans on the model makes them look a bit baggy, but that\u2019s not my experience. They\u2019re fairly slim fitting but not too slim. They also stretch quite a bit, so bending down or squatting in them is done without concern for the jeans ripping. I wish there were more colors available in my size because I would buy them all.",
        "I\u2019ve bought Lucky for many years. Good medium-priced jeans. These were loose on me though. Big in the butt area and thighs. I was hoping for something more tight. These are the slim fit ones too. Maybe I\u2019m just too skinny in all the wrong areas.",
        "I thought the 121 Heritage Jeans were all made of super soft, almost brushed cotton feeling type of material.  I have owned two pairs prior in different dyes and remember that in the boutique, all the different colors had the same material.These jeans are much stiffer than my previous ones.  However, the fit is the same which is why I kept it.  Seems to be the best fitting jeans for my body type.  I haven't been in a mall since before the pandemic, but the next time I do, I will check out the Lucky Jeans store and compare.  Most likely, these are just coming from a more cost efficient factory due to the high cost of selling on Amzn.  I'm glad the fit was the same unlike trying to buy a pair of Levi's on here.I took one star off because the pockets are much smaller.  The workers in this factory must all use flip phones.  Its not just the top edge that sticks out.  Enough of my phone sticks out of the front pockets for all to know that it is not an iPhone.  Be warned if you have an Android.",

        "Poor quality bottom of legs frayed like it was a secondPrior orders made in Mexico this one was china denim was of poor quality compared to prior purchases",

        "I used to resent (still do tbh) wearing long pants/ jeans, as I was gifted with tree trunk thighs and a lot of cake.  Lucky brand jeans do not feel you're wearing jeans.  Lucky 121's are the pants for me.  They fit in all of the right places and have enough stretch to move around without feeling constricted. This is my 4th pair of 121's (1/3 previous pairs was lost to wear, 2/3 due to weight fluctuations)  These are the perfect jeans for any occasion.  As an engineer I find myself in the office 50% of the time and in the field the other 50%; these jeans are stylish enough for office casual and bar hopping, while being rugged enough to wear to work at an mining/aggregate facility.",

Sleeves are good and long and the torso is slightly longer than on some which I really like. I'd call this a mid weight, warm in the winter and I've worn it with shorts in warmer weather. Sleeves won't really roll up but I haven't found that to be bothersome. Quality is second to none, I'd give this 10 stars if I could. LOVE IT!",
        "I love these Timberland Pro Understory pullovers.  I own 4 of them.  I loved this black digital camo version. I think that the fact that these are as warm and comfortable as they are considering how light the fabric itself is, speaks volumes about Timberlands innovative product lines. The Rain repel technology is very useful for me, as I'm out in the elements everyday. If you're on the fence, pull the trigger.  I literally only buy Timberland pro clothes for work.... and now for my home wardrobe as well.",

        "The black digital camo is not what is shown. The photo is probably the black color.Be advised for some reason Timberland put a neon blaze orange zipper and trim on this flece and a blaze orange logo. Then it appears they tried to conceal this by using the wrong photo and conveniently failing to mention the BRIGHT ORANGE TRIM anywhere in the description. This simply does not make sense and does not appear to be an innocent mistake. In addition the sleeves are too short to utilize the thumb holes effectively but oddly the length of the 'body' of the fleece is too too long by probably 4 inches. It should be hip length - yet it is at least 2 inches past my crotch. The shoulder width and chest size are appropriate for a large. For the record I wear a large in every makers sizing model until this one and very, very rarely have I ended up with such terrible proportions for a size Large Also be advised that this has a thin fleece-like lining but the outside is not what one thinks of as fleece and it is not very substantial.  This is my first Timberline Pro outer wear piece and will probably be the last. I Hope others find this informative.",

        "A sweater is the ultimate clothing item for staying warm and cozy. Whether it's a chilly winter day or a cool summer evening, a sweater is there to provide comfort and protection. Its soft and knitted fabric feels gentle against the skin, making it a pleasure to wear.One of the greatest advantages of a sweater is its versatility. It can be dressed up or down, depending on the occasion. Pair it with jeans for a casual look, or wear it over a dress for a more elegant ensemble. With so many colors, patterns, and styles to choose from, there's a sweater for every taste and preference.Not only does a sweater keep you warm, but it also adds a touch of style to your outfit. From chunky cable-knit sweaters to sleek and form-fitting designs, there's a wide range of options to suit any fashion sense. Sweaters can be accessorized with scarves, hats, and jewelry to create a unique and personalized look.Another benefit of a sweater is its durability. Well-made sweaters are built to last, making them a wise investment in your wardrobe. With proper care, a sweater can withstand years of wear and still maintain its shape and quality.In addition to its practicality and style, a sweater also holds sentimental value. It can remind us of cherished memories, like cozy evenings by the fireplace or family gatherings during the holidays. Wearing a favorite sweater can evoke feelings of comfort, nostalgia, and a sense of belonging.In conclusion, a sweater is the optimal choice for both fashion and function. It keeps us warm, adds a stylish touch to our outfits, and holds sentimental value. So, next time you're getting dressed, don't forget to reach for that trusty sweater! Stay cozy, my friend! \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udde5",
        "I am very large, and have difficulty finding stuff to fit me.  These came in 4XL and fit me comfortably. I found them warm as well so I can throw them on to go outside to the car when it's cold.  They have built in front pockets so you can keep your hands warm too. They are well made and were very inexpensive (not common for big and tall items).",
        "Multiple family members have this type of hoodie and my kid asked for this brand exactly because it's so soft against the skin & very comfortable. They're also pretty durable as far as wear and tear we haven't had to throw one out or had one get really tattered looking despite daily use and regular washes. It's warm on it's own but not super thick so great for layering too which we do in NY when it's freezing. You can easily get thermals & a sweatshirt under it then your big coat over it. True to size and roomy",
        "If you\u2019re looking for a light hoodie this is it. It\u2019s nice and soft. The only thing is that it does shrink a bit since it\u2019s cotton so might want to consider upping in size",
        "Got it quick, put it on and it\u2019s very light and comfortable and a perfect fit. I ordered the XL size.Would get again if I need another one and the price was right.",
        "I bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew. He absolutely loves it! Orange is his favorite color! I wasn't sure about how it would fit, but it was exactly the right size with room to spare! I will definitely buy this again! The color was very vibrant and the material was soft to touch. My nephew said that it is very warm.",
        "This is such a comfortable sweatshirt.  It is not very thick which makes it perfect for Spring/ \"Winter\" in Texas.  When it is in the 40s when I go to work but 70s when I leave I needed a sweatshirt that was comfortable enough to wear during that range of temperatures and this fits the bill perfectly.",
        "Bought two for my hubby who does 3rd shift warehouse work. The fit is great according to the size chart, long bodied, good zipper, and stitched well with a medium weight fabric. Roomy hood with no stretch on the head-neck space...very comfortable. Of course this is according to my husband's body shape and length, but I believe the size is accurate.",

        "Comfortable sock. Holds shape well. Durable. Pulls on easily. In all my looking I haven't found a better sock than Gold Toe. I like this Stanton model for dress pants. They are thicker than a normal dress sock--I like the extra comfort. They also work nicely for casual wear (jeans, chinos). Tip: If your foot is between sizes, go a size up. At least that works way better for me. Feedback to manufacturer/seller: I wish we could create our own color pack rather than being forced to buy a preordained assortment of colors.",
        "Really high quality and great fit. Color variety gives me what I need to go with most everything.  Would buy again.",
        "Something about a new pair of socks!",
        "Quality socks in beautiful colors.  A bit thin compared to other Gold Toe styles.",
        "Excellent price in comparison to other sellers. My husband only wears this brand due to quality and durability.",
        "I bought these for my Dad and he absolutely loves them.  He was worried about the fit since he takes a size 12 shoe but they fit great.  He asked me to buy more for him!",
        "Disclosure - I have always liked and purchased Timberland socks. This last purchase included 2 bundle packs of the Men's socks. The darkest blue color was and still appears to be great! But, the light(er) blue color pairs, did not sustain more than a few wash cycles. It does appear to me that the latter is of a different lot of material, where you can easily see the fibers are detaching from the webbing of the sock at the back-of-heel, and underfoot top of sole area. There are no tears, just the premature disintegration of the material.This happened with a purchase before this one as well, but it took many washed before that happened.I'm hoping Timberland sees the review and would look to change their supplier for the one coming in the lighter and lightest blue colors.",
        "As usual, Gold Toe socks are such a great buy.  Good looks , great fit and they seem to last forever.  That is why I always purchase them!",

They are completely different.Now they are too tall, big and baggy, the old style fit my feet perfectly.Really sad they changed them.And yes, these are the same size and brand and style, purchased from the same Amazon listing.",
        "definitely not XL socks for someone who takes size 12-13, too bad because they are a nice dress sock.",
        "Very comfortable socks.",
        "They are too tight hard to get on, once on they are not bad"

The cons are the hood does feel a bit heavy at first but I quickly got used to it after wearing it two or three times and now I don't even feel the hood.  Same with the quarter zipper, it is very sturdy and a bit heavy at first mainly due to its quality but that too I got used too.

I wear wool socks almost exclusively every to kick around, work and train (run, hike, bike). These are the socks I always go for. They keep perspiration away better than anything else leaving your feet feeling fresher for longer. I\u2019ve had one pair for over a year and worn them probably 45 times with no signs of them becoming thread bare. My son is a national champ in XC and he\u2019s taken a pair of mine for his own because they are better than any other sock for hard training in dampish conditions. No bunching or blisters.",

I had an issue with blistering on the back of my heel previously so got the ankle and quarter length socks as a trial.  They worked great.  I have not had a blister since using the same running shoe.  I ordered the crew length as a winter sock.  I found that the quarter sock left a bit of my lower leg 'exposed'.  In the cold, I wear a pair of RockBros lined cycling pants.  The socks work to keep me warm, but I don't seem to have sweaty feet after.",

        "6'3\" 240lbs and the XXL fit perfectly.  Weight was good for temps in the 50s with just a tshirt on underneath.  Snaps seem like they could pull through if you try to rip the shirt open aggressively but if you pull each one apart intentionally they should be good.  Overall a good purchase.",
        "Was looking for a \"sh-acket\" that was not only lightweight but provided warmth and flexibility as I like working outside.The outside is more durable than a regular flannel and looks sharp. The inside has flannel on the back down to the bottom with the sleeves being more traditional material.I am 6'3\" about 230 with a slender build. I love buying in Large-Tall and this is a perfect fit. Goes a little past the waist and when I reach my arms above my head it's at belt length. If I had gone with an XL it would have been shorter and wider which isn't my favorite fit.Quality is good and has been through the wash (as directed). Have Legendary Whitetails bookmarked as a quality clothing line. Right up there with Eddie Bauer, Kuhl, and Pantagonia but much cheaper.",
        "I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That\u2019s a winner in my opinion",
        "The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11\" and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket.",

The waist button is difficult to button and unbutton because it is too large.  The waist button is poorly and loosely sewn on which means it will break loose prematurely.  These slacks should also be offered in a polyester weave or poly/cotton blend that is mostly polyester which will make them wick water away from the body.

        "With the decline in material for most of the big athletic shoe brand-names' socks (e.g., Nike, NB, etc.), I've been on the hunt for quality Athletic Socks that also are good at reducing Odor. Thanks to Amazon reviews and additional research, I took a chance on these Copper Fit Sport Socks. And having used them for over 1.5 years, I finally wrote a review to say:IT WORKS!They are comfortable, not too hot, have good support, AND they dramatically reduce odor. I can go for a full 3 hours workout at my local gym, do cardio, go for a 5k hike, etc., come back, take off my socks and (as gross as it sounds), do a smell test on the socks, and there's No Smell / Odor! I was very surprised.With how cheaply made the big shoe brand's socks are (super thin, cheaply made), if I wear them for even a quick workout and come back, they smell immediately. These Copper Fit socks can be used for a couple days' workouts (I've even used them for 3 days in a row for gym visits, taken them off, and no smell).Even after 1.5 years of using my first 3 pack of these socks, they are still fine. Tip: Since they are black, I wash them on a Color washing cycle, gentle, with Dark Colors Laundry Detergent. I dry them on Medium (not full blast high heat) and they've held up with no issues. Thanks for all the previous helpful reviews!",
        "I suffer from plantar fasciitis and when I wear this socks you feel the compression, but not to the point where it's comfortable.  I experience a much lower level of discomfort (almost no discomfor) from plantar fasciitis as I do with regular socks.",
        "These are very soft and comfy. They are great ankle socks that stay up. No issues with them sliding down my heel. They are just the right fit - They are tight enough but not so tight they leave a mark around my ankle. I have yet to be convinced of any help from the copper aspect of any of the copper fit products but I will say they make good items. I also tried the arch compression and it does offer some help with my arches. Again I don't think there is merit to the copper aspect but the compression does help. I have had injuries to both of my ankles and multiple injuries to one ankle, so my feet have issues from time to time including plantar fasciitis, general aching and swelling, supination and such. Not much helps when it flares up except the usual RICE. But I  love a good comfy sock.",
        "Buy it!, soft and I can\u2019t feel any seams inside like other socks.  Nice for running, workout, hiking and everyday use I have been using copper fit for years now",

They\u2019re thin and no-show but have the heel tab, which makes for a nice balance between comfort and style. No cushioning at all really so I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019ll give you great performance on something like a multi-day hike.

The ankle area has a bit of padding to prevent slippage, but the rest of the socks are very lightweight.

        "These sweaters are really nice and colors are as shown. They run true to size and both my father and my husband wear them frequently. They wash and dry well and ours get washed a lot and are holding up just fine.",
        "It's comfortable and it fits. Color is good. Got brown heather. Good material.",
        "I like the Amazon Essentials Quarter-Zip Sweaters a lot but wanted to try one with a zipper so I don't have to pull it on and off, which is a pain.  My experience with the Quarter-Zips is that they fit well and look sporty (see 3rd pic).This Full-Zip is more convenient to take on and off, but has a few issues compared to the Quarter-Zip.  For one, the arms are longer than the same size in the Quarter-Zip and so I have to fold the cuffs back to make them fit (for record I am slim, 5'8\", 150 lbs, and wear 32-33\" sleeves).Second, as others have said, the zipper on the Full-Zip tends to catch on the material around it and you often have to wrestle with it to get it to zip up.  Third, the Full-Zip doesn't look quite as sporty and ends up looking more like a \"dad\" sweater.  Finally, the Full-Zips are not as warm as the Quarter-Zips.These issues are minor to me since it is so hard to find all-cotton sweaters these days, so I am glad these are being offered.  However if I wanted to look my best I would wear the Quarter-Zip and save the Full-Zip for more casual knocking around.  And if Amazon can also create some cotton sweaters with patterns, that would be awesome.",
        "Very good and soft fabric, suits perfect. In a autumn chill definately will keep warm. Very good for smart casual style.",
        "Every time I get an Amazon Essentials garment I am  impressed.  I bought two of these sweaters and love the heck out of them.  They are heavy and warm.  I wanted a middle to heavy sweater and these are it.  I have two knocks on them though.  One note I found odd from a review I read from someone else.  They mentioned the material around the zipper that makes it hard to zip up.  I thought , wow, someone is being really picky but yeah they were right.  The zipper is kind of encompassed in the sweater material.  I've gotten use to it now but I do wish it was just a little easier to zip up.  And the other thing is the sizing.  I am 5' 10'' and 170pounds.  I bought a large thinking it will be a little big but it will shrink when I wash it, plus I wear it over two shirts.  The sleeve length and the shoulder length are a good bit too long, but iI turn the cuffs up and it looks really good, but the arms and torso fit like what I imagined a medium would fit like, almost snug. So it is kind of an odd fit. As far as warmth I work in a large warehouse type building that is typically in the winter between 50 and 60 degrees on a concrete floor.  It's always cool.  I wear a long sleeve T-shirt, a button down Oxford cloth shirt and this sweater over top and stay very comfortable.  I have not washed either one of these sweaters yet.  I will post an update as to whether they shrink of not.  But again very pleased with how they look and feel and keep me warmUpdate 12 28 21 / My 2nd season of wearing.  I have washed and dried these several times and I don't believe they shrink at all.  I've now bought 5 different colors and absolutely love them all.  The two blue sweaters are closer in color than what it looks like online though.  But a great deal.",
        "This sweater is pretty light so it's useful to wear at work. Looks nice too, over a uniform or whatever. I like how the collar sticks up a little bit. Adds a nice flair. It's not super warm though so you'll probably need an extra layer on outside of it. It has some inside pockets I found to be useful though a phone is too heavy for this sweater.. it drags that side down a lot. The only downside that I've found that, when zipped, the zipper line flows down right. So it doesn't have a nice straight line down to my crotch. I adjust it back to the center all the time. Maybe one side is longer than the other? I'm not sure. I washed it once and followed the instructions. Overall, great layering piece.",

        "What a surprise to find a garment that runs large!Reading reviews, indeed this Wrangler fleece quarter zip runs large, so I ordered a size Large and it fit hubby perfectly - as he wears this over a dress shirt at a casual work setting. ( Amazon Basic quarter zip pullover fit him great in size XL, just to compare sizes.)The fabric is a lighter to midweight fleece- type fabric, but the exterior of the pullover seems to have a nap to it... that can catch little pieces of things ( like when cutting cardboard boxes at work ) and sticks on.It wouldn't be noticeable if worn going out to eat or something ... but just to mention that.The contrast inner collar appears as a shiny fabric surface in the photos, but in person is a lot more subtle and appropriate to the casual style of the pullover.  (The dark blue Mood Indigo color has a black fabric collar and is almost matte in terms of sheen.)Washing per instructions inside- out (protects the 1/4 zipper ) takes care of the  pieces stuck on the fabric and it washes and dries up beautifully, with no changes in size.Would order again.",
        "I am 6'4\", 280lbs., with a 37-inch sleeve in a dress shirt.  The Wrangler Fleece quarter zip is well-made, with an excellent zipper and zipper fob.  I ordered a size XXL and it was too big for me.  There is no cuffing or trim on the sleeves or the bottoms of the body, so the sweatshirt hangs loose on you.  The sleeves were well past my wrist with my arms down and the body was 5 inches or so below the beltline.  It drapes the body rather than conforming to it.  The inside of the fabric is very comfortable and warm.  The outside is made of a rough-cut material that gathers lint and crumbs and is hard to pick these items off the material without pulling on the cloth potentially making it pill up.  I paid more for this item than the usual zippered sweatshirt and expected it to be a better, more stylish fit.",

        "I got two pairs of these in Black Stripe L/XL for my boyfriend who typically wears 10.5/11 shoes. They fit perfectly and he loves them!Now, he was a little skeptical about trying them, because he is a 10-pack of crew socks kinda guy, but his feet had been hurting from walking all day doing street photography. I told him the ladies version helped me with very achy feet and knees at work, that I got them on sale (they still cost more than 10 pair of his regular socks, but, better than MSRP!) and to *please, just give them a try*! He gave me \"the look\" and put them in the sock drawer.Well, it took him a few weeks to even break open the packaging, but when he got home that evening after his first wearing he pretty much immediately exclaimed that the socks were fantastic and his feet felt so much better with them. Just like he is the kind of guy to wear $1 socks, he is also the guy who doesn't fluff things up - he shoots straight. So, this proclamation meant he meant it!  Now, he doesn't wear them daily, but if he is going to be walking a lot, he puts these babies on because he knows they work. And now I have a new stocking stuffer idea. :PHope this review helps someone with their tired, sore feet. Best of luck!UPDATE 01/06/2018: I wanted to update that these socks are still going strong for my boyfriend. They are his most expensive pair and he wears them when he knows he will be on his feet all day. Something of note: He must have acidic sweat because he wears holes through all his socks like crazy - these socks are still in perfect shape after 2 years where he has \"killed\" other socks in months. Definitely a winner in my book!",

I find the all synthetic compression socks to be hot and very uncomfortable to wear. The sockwell on the other hand are as comfortable as I feel compression socks can be.",
        "I stand all day and use compression socks. I have gone through multiple varieties. These are pretty good. They are not so snug that getting them on is a struggle. They are a little long...they go above my knee and I fold down a bit. I am 5'10\" and with a 32 inseam the length still seems a bit much.I like the feel and wear. So, a nice easy to put on pair of support hose... not real tight. Perhaps a bit long",

The thing I don't like is that these feel like a cheap hospital gown.  The outer fabric feels almost like paper, and makes plenty of noise when I walk around from it rubbing against itself.  Also, there is virtually no give to this fabric, so exercising in them feels restrictive because they don't flex when I do.  They feel like they will very easily tear, but I've had a few pairs for a couple months that I wear around the house and exercise in, and they are holding up fine.",
        "Fit well and super comfy. All seams are nice and tight with no loose threads anywhere. This is my second pair of Puma sweats and I'm digging the look and feel of them. I consider this a great buy at only $20.99 as of December of 2023. Back to fitment, I generally wear an XX-Large due to my legs and these fit well, not too loose and not too tight. They allow me to move freely and perform exercises in the gym with ease.A solid 5-star and highly recommended item. I can't recommend these enough.",

        "Great thermal underwear, nice fit and comfortable! Nice and warm outside for those cold days!",
        "These are very comfortable and do their job quite nicely out in the bitter cold. My first time out in the elements with them was at around 0 degrees F, with just one layer of slacks over top of these. Not a bad run out \u2014 kept me pretty warm. I went with XL but probably should\u2019ve gone with L. I\u2019m a 33-34ish waist and these are a bit big around the middle, but not so bad that they\u2019re falling down. It helps that I either have on a belt or tighter pants to keep these babies from dropping around my ankles.",
        "The waist band is the problem here. Way too loose and they fall down on their own. They are tight fitting and very comfortable to wear to bed and under an additional layer...just needs a differnt waist band. Great for staying warm",

        "I was on the fence about getting these and I'm very happy that I did. Extremely comfortable and warm, breathable, close fit but not tight, they don't ride up or down at all. Thinking about getting a few more pairs. My jeans size is 38-40 depending on the brand and the xl are perfect.",

        "I'm 6'1\", slim build, 185 lbs. 33x32 is usually my best pants size and these fit perfectly. So as far as I'm concerned, these are property sized. Waist is snug, medium rise (I don't like low rise pants), with a bit of elastic for some stretch.It's a good twill material. They don't shrink in the wash. Colors and are great... Sort of a \"straight-slim fit\". They really look nice.Pros: these are all around great casual pants that can also be dressed up. Very durable without looking like \"work pants\". Great for casual office wear, and pairs with just about anything. I love all the colors, I bought one of each. I expect they'll last a good while, and for $30 it would be hard for me to find pants that feel/look/fit this good from a store.Cons are minor: the material could be a bit softer (but they do soften after a few washes), and the dark colors will attract/show more lint than a pairs of jeans will.",
        "I have gone into stores and bought some of the Wrangler products before and they have been fairly consistent. With that in mind, I took a chance and went ahead and bought these pants to see how they would fare. Amazing pair of jeans here. I really like not only the material, which is very comfortable, but the quality and the fit, which is spot on. (For reference, I ordered the 34x30 Twill jeans). And, at a shade under $30, you really can't beat the price at all, especially if you go into a department store and pay at least double for a pair of jeans that might not even fit as good or be as comfortable. I really love these jeans, and will be ordering other variations of these. They are casual enough to wear anywhere, but still good for work as well. Very comfortable, durable, and inexpensive. Great buy!",
        "Great pair of pants, but much thinner material than regular denim. More like a light chino material. Comfortable all around.",
        "These are my go to pants. The thistle and major brown are the most comfortable and nice fabric. It isn't like a Jean, but it's kinda like soft canvas pant. It is really nice and they seem durable as well! I have 3 pair. Will probably get a 4th. Great pants.",

        "The Southpole Men's Athletic Gym Mesh Shorts with Pockets are a versatile and practical choice for your workout wardrobe. These shorts are designed with a lightweight and breathable mesh fabric that helps keep you cool and comfortable during your exercise sessions. The quick-dry feature ensures that you stay dry even during intense workouts, while the pockets provide convenient storage for your essentials such as keys or a phone. Whether you're hitting the gym, going for a run, or engaging in any other physical activity, these shorts offer both style and functionality to support your active lifestyle.",
        "I'm 6'01\" and 176 lbs and bought a size large. My waist is between a 34 and a 36 but definitely closer to a 34 (I wish they made size 35 because that would be perfect). The shorts fit my waist perfectly. They are super well made. They are thick and have 2 layers. The only small issue is that they are are slightly too long for me.  They fit so well on my waist that I would not go down to a size medium because although they may be a bit shorter, they will probably be too tight. I like my shorts on the long side, meaning down to the top of my knees. These shorts go right to the bottom of my knees. It is not a ridiculous length, but I am using them for lifting weights in the gym which usually includes me wearing tight fitting shirts that wick away the sweat rather than cotton t-shirts that absorb it and are looser fitting. The shorts appear a little larger when paired with a tight shirt. You might have to end up wearing them higher up on your waist. For a typical baggy basketball style, they are perfect. Overall, they are great high quality shorts. I would give them a 9 out of 10.  I would definitely buy them again and will look at the other colors.",
        "Shorts are light and right fit. Material seems to be comfortable. But the length is a couple inches too long for my taste. Anyway, for the price and brand, I can get used to it. It's not like I have to spend 8\u201310 hours a day wearing them.",
        "Very comfortable, lightweight, and breathable which is great if you suffer from Schweddy balls. They're cheaply made (sloppy stitching) but what do you expect for $14-$16 shipped to your door? I wear my pair a lot and it has no holes/tears, discoloration or anything after about 4-5 months.I'm 6' 1\", 415lbs (Amazon only goes up to 400lbs if you want to include height and weight in reviews (Guess they discriminate against chubbies) and wear a 52 waist in jeans. I almost bought a 4x because lots of people said these run small but I went ahead and got a 3X and they fit me a little baggy/loose. I've nearly lost them a few times when carrying groceries and stuff lol.I like the loose fit, it's more comfortable for lounging around...guess I just need to tighten the drawstring more and not put as much stuff in the pockets.I like them so much I just came back to order another pair so I can alternate and have a pair while the others in the laundry.",
        "Comfortable, lightweight, nice fabric, tag says $28.00. Nice blue color.",
        "Pockets are too shallow to hold anything reliably. Otherwise, they're comfortable and pretty decent.",
        "Very lightweight and LONG (I'm very tall) which is exactly what I was looking for and are a great value at $13.00. The only down point is that the stitching is cheap and the mesh material is pretty thin. One of the pockets did rip a hole after a few weeks of wearing them but haven't had any issues with the other seven pairs I have.I don't expect these to last beyond a few years, but I don't know what people expecting for $13.00 Mesh basketball shorts. As far as quality goes, you'll be hard press to find better athletic shorts that are this long at this price.",
        "Figured I'd pull the trigger on some cheap athletic shorts since so many brands seem to think a basic garment like this should cost $30+ and, yeah I guess you get what you pay for. For starters the fit is just way off, like way smaller than advertised.  This isn't a huge problem because they're athletic shorts so they're pretty forgiving, but still.  Not a great first impression and far from the only problem.The second thing, and the weirdest, is that these shorts are simultaneously too long and too short.  The legs are way longer than I would've expected, they hang well below my knee almost to mid-calf.  Maybe this is how you like your shorts, but these things are stretching the definition of shorts to a ridiculous degree.  They're basically stovepipe 3/4 length pants made from the same material as actual athletic shorts.So that's too long, but how are they also too short?  Well with the shorts pulled up to your normal/mid waist, just at or bellow the navel, the gusset (ahem ... crotch) is pulled up so high into my gooch it feels like someone's trying to lasso my flesh fun patch.  Seriously, who tf thought this design was a good idea!  It's so uncomfortable that the only way to wear these and have them feel like a normal pair of athletic shorts, as far as the gooch is concerned, is to wear them way down low on/below the hips.  This is not how athletic shorts work, they'll just slide off, and anyway because the legs are so ridiculously long they'll be regular pants at this point. It's almost like whoever designed these shorts had only a passing familiarity with human physiology.Oh that's not the end ...The pockets.  How can you screw up pockets?  Make them the size of a standard US shot glass, that's how.  I literally can't put my phone in these pockets.  I can just barely fit a wallet in there, but nothing bigger.  How?  How are these this bad?And lastly the material itself.  It seems high quality, it's certainly a heavy fabric.  Too heavy.  Way too heavy!  These are meant to be worn while being active and yet these things are so heavy they forever trap heat and sweat in their abyssal folds for the life-age of the universe.  And what's weirder?  There seem to be inner and outer layers of fabric, almost like swim trunks, which don't lie naturally on the thighs so that you have to pull the bottom hem of the short legs to get them to fall out correctly.  Unbelievable.Look I get that humans come in different shapes and sizes and I'd never fault a company for running a little large or a little small, but I do expect clothing I purchase to come in a roughly human shape.  These shorts are so poorly designed and so strangely cut that I'm not sure they fit the legal definition of clothing.  Textile?  Yes.  Shorts for humans?  No.  By all means trust the glowing reviews of satisfied customers singing the praises of these shorts, but also consider that you might just be better off throwing your money into the toilet.  Because that's what these shorts remind me of ... something you'd find in a toilet.",

        "I\u2019m old school late 90s-2000s were my particular era..I didn\u2019t do jinkos, and I damn sure wont wear skinny pants(ridiculous) my go to jeans were always Buckle..Big Star Orion boot cut, they sat lower on the waist, snug not tight in the thigh, with a 19-21 inch opening, as I am a boot/T-shirt guy they were perfect\u2026 they stopped making them and now everything I like is called \u201cvintage\u201d and I had to dig through eBay and other second hand clothing sites to find them because eventually there\u2019s just not any material left to work with..I also never ever ever got the destroyed jeans..I always thought\u2026why would I buy destroyed jeans\u2026they are gonna look like that eventually(and they always did) if I buy them already worn/destroyed then the shelf/hanger/washer/dryer life of them are maybe 1/10th of what it would be..anyway second hand sites worked for a while but sizes and age ultimately dwindled to a point I had to start looking..while these are not exactly like my Orions, I\u2019m older and fatter, (hey..20 years to go from 29-30 waist to a 32-33 is not as bad as it could be) when I found the dimensions and compared, I gave them a shot..and it was good. I really like the Lucky brand, I just hope they keep making the damned things..I also like that the makers must have a sense of humor\u2026the inside of the fly(after unzipping) says \u201cLucky You\u201d that alone gets a couple stars from me..they fit just fine for me, I was afraid they might be tight from other reviews..(it\u2019s possible they are in denial) I\u2019m a solid 33 in everything else and these are almost perfect..my one and only one thing I am not a big fan of is the mix of material, it\u2019s got that bit of  stretch in the denim\u2026I get why they do it and I don\u2019t mind it enough to change my opinion, it really does make fitting easier but Im a purist about that..I know this is a ridiculously long review\u2026but I am particular about jeans and I know I appreciate more info when I can\u2019t just run through 5 pairs at the store to find the right fit\u2026I\u2019ll certainly buy more..that\u2019s certain.",
        "I like the look of them. They fit well.  A bit low on the waist but that is me.  What surprised me is how stretchy they are.  A bit too much to my liking but other than than they look great.",
        "Great fit and comfortable. Great Value",
        "I am in between 33 and 34. The fabric allows comfort fit",
        "The only issue I have, but seems like it is an issue with most, is the fact that the jeans aren't as durable as they used to be. I have a job that required 10 to 20 miles of walking, each day, and these hold up for maybe 4 months before the crotch starts to give out.",
        "But they do function as pants as far as I can tell.",
        "This is the third pair of jeans I have ordered from Lucky Brand in the last couple months. The fit and feel are absolutely perfect. I can't speak on the durability of these since they are all still new. The newer material that is a little elastic is a nice and makes them very comfortable. I hope that these will last as long as jeans that are without the elastic material. I plan on buying more pairs of jeans from Lucky Brand in the very near future.",

But I was looking for a coat for not that cold days as i have thick wool coats for cold days already. Found the exactly the same coat and without bib here. Everything is as expected and i like the simple and clean look of it. The coat has 25% wool and can be machine washed. Not sure if the material is resistant to pilling, probably not.

        "I was skeptical at first because I usually buy Marmot parkas not bubble coats. However the sale price, the additional 20% clip coupon and my gift card brought it down to about 83% off retail price.Only downside was that the XL on sale not L. I am a 42 and the XL is definitely an XL (44) The jacket is very warm in 29F degree weather with a hoodie underneath. I own a Yukon 2 Parka and a Mammoth both in Large but I was looking at another jacket for my rotation and this didnt break the bank. The Cilantro color is not to flashy and it feels very smooth. Its not to puffy either.My only complaint but is not a dealbreaker is a detachable hood. I like being able to remove and snap it back on depending if there is rain or snow, since I always wear a hoodie or hat.Final thoughts: Ideal for NYC weather, very warm and if it gets to hot you can zip open the buttom zipper. Nice texture, no feathers yet, true to size. Will consider buying more Stockholms in the future for gifts and the family.",
        "While the MARMOT Men\u2019s Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket II boasts impressive warmth and a sleek design, my overall experience has been somewhat marred by sizing issues that left me feeling less than satisfied.The jacket's insulation with its high fill power undeniably provides exceptional warmth, making it a reliable choice for colder climates. The down material is both cozy and efficient at trapping heat, ensuring I stay comfortably warm in chilly weather.However, the sizing was a significant letdown. Despite carefully following the sizing chart, the jacket turned out to be much larger than expected. The fit was boxy, and the excess material detracted from the stylish appearance I had hoped for. The oversized look was not the sleek silhouette I anticipated.Additionally, while the jacket's overall design is functional and straightforward, it lacks the tailored aesthetic I had imagined. The puffiness, exacerbated by the larger size, diminished the jacket's stylish appeal. It's unfortunate that the visual appeal didn't match my expectations, considering the reputation of MARMOT for producing quality outdoor wear.On a positive note, the jacket's build quality is commendable. The durable exterior and quality stitching are indicative of MARMOT's commitment to crafting reliable products. The jacket's resistance to wind and water is a notable plus, providing added protection in unpredictable weather conditions.In summary, the MARMOT Men\u2019s Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket II is a well-made piece with outstanding warmth, but the sizing discrepancies and unexpected appearance have left me slightly disappointed. If considering this jacket, I would recommend sizing down for a more flattering fit. While it excels in functionality, the style may not meet everyone's expectations, so it's crucial to manage sizing expectations before purchasing.",
        "I really enjoy this jacket. I am 6 ft tall, yet the XL jacket is longer than it looks on the model. The bonus is that its back is a bit longer than front. Also the hands in the pockets feel warm protected by a thick layer of goose down.",
        "Light weight and very warm and comfortable.",
        "Otherwise great.",
        "A very well-made, packable insulation piece.  No, it\u2019s not for the Polar Circle, so don\u2019t expect it to be overstuffed. My blue has a very slight sheen to it  -likely from the treatment to make it a little precip resistant- but it\u2019s not \u201cshiny\u201d.  The 700 fill provides comfortable warm and is appropriate for the intent of the jacket.  Low profile cuffs and detachable hood make it an excellent choice for a packable, bail-out piece or something to provide the light-traveling speed hiker a warm piece for days end around the Jetboil.",
        "The earlier version from last year had 3 pockets inside with metal zippers outside , veru warm; this one is a. crappy skinny coat with most likely imitation down ; 40F and not warm at all !!",
        "Compared to the top brands of winter outer ware, the Marmot puffer holds its own\u2026maybe it doesn\u2019t have the cache of other brands, however, this is a capable down jacket at a third of the price.  You will not be disappointed."

        "I couldn't find what I needed in the women's section. None of the swim tees i ordered seemed to fit properly. This was perfect for me! It was just the fit I need with the right length of sleeves so why not? I tried it and it was wonderful. Loose and light!",
        "Fits good, comfortable and quick drying\u2026as advertised.",
        "This Swim Tee was great for our last family vacation, and will go with me on future vacations as well. This shirt has become my go-to for snorkeling, and here's why:Firstly, it's light and comfortable. The fabric feels great against the skin, and it doesn't weigh you down, making it perfect for extended water activities. Snorkeling, in particular, can be a sunburn risk for the back, but this tee has you covered \u2013 literally. The UPF 50 protection worked like a charm, ensuring a worry-free underwater experience.The black color not only adds a touch of style but also serves a practical purpose. It absorbs the sun's heat, helping the shirt dry quickly after getting out of the water. No one wants to feel like a walking sponge, and this tee keeps you comfortably dry in no time.Now, speaking from the perspective of someone in their 50s, this tee is a savior. It offers a bit of extra coverage for that post-50 belly we all seem to acquire, and I appreciate the confidence boost it provides. Plus, let's be honest, my pale complexion is better left to the fish below. This tee prevents me from blinding my fellow beachgoers when I decide to go shirtless.In summary, the Men's Short-Sleeve Quick-Dry UPF 50 Swim Tee is more than just a shirt \u2013 it's a sun-smart, comfortable, and stylish addition to your swim gear. Whether you're concerned about sunburn, drying off quickly, or just want to feel good in your skin, this tee has you covered, literally and figuratively. Highly recommended for a worry-free and enjoyable beach experience!",

        "I originally bought a set of these nearly a decade ago for travel and they've held up really well. They don't have a super constricting cuff and are comfy through the forefoot (and warm enough) for long international flights. I recently had an injury that required compression socks and others hurt. I dug out my old receipts and bought a bunch more of these and they've held up well against the swelling, remain super comfortable, don't have any hot spots and really help with recovery. They are a good value. I've done some basic workouts in them, and due to the warmth (which is really nice for day-to-day wear) I wouldn't do strenuous aerobic exercise in them.",
        "Fit is a bit personal - but here goes.  These socks fit my feet just right for comfort there and they do have graduated compression.  They seem strong.  I just got them - so I can't say how well they'll hold up in the wash (I use delicate cycle / woolite detergent) and air dry in the dryer for these.  I had a different brand before - but wanted to try these.  I found the mediums just right with a 9.5 foot size and I actually have reasonably large calves (I'm 5'9\" and 165 lb male and mediums are just right).  These are comfortable and seemed cooler after I washed them.  I bought enough pairs for the week.  I hope they hold up well.  Edit after several months:  still good.If your legs swell, you may want to try these supplements, too:I still use rutin (a low dose brand) and also use Swanson Diosvein (diosmin and Hesperidin) and also with the Now brand Silymarin (milk thistle extract) and ORAC energy greens which all also contain flavinoids.  The different flavinoids all seem to work together to promote vascular health (less leg swelling / less excessive bleeding;  less anything bad about unhealthy veins / circulation).  See if these help leg swelling, too.",
        "The pursuit of the perfect support work sox.I have what I consider normal size calves..5'10\" and 170 lbs. I stand all day.1,) Features...great support, too snug. Took five minutes to put them on. Great support but not what I needed.2.) Work sox. Easy to put one..and good padding. Not as much support but easily comfortable and good all day long.3.) Swiftwick. A great light weight sock. Only goes to the upper calf, but good for summer use or light use. Easy on and good support.Five stars.4.) Injinji 2.0 Compression Over The Calf Toesocks. I hated them. What a pain to put on. Who ever thought using toe socks was a good idea. Never again.5.) Vitalsox. These are almost identical to the Work sox but a little lighter. Easy on, good support and they go up all the way up the calf. The ohly reason only four stars.. I wear these in the office and there is this silly logo that is on the ankle area that is visible when I sit and the pants go up. Why they make this sock and feel the need to advertise the company when you are wearing dress pants is incomprehensible.So, Vitalsox, get rid of the logo on the calf... then five stars",
        "The best of three brands I have tried. They really concentrate on my foot and don't strangle my calf. They fit me fairly well but I do roll the top down one layer as they are a bit tall for me unless I have a lot of inflammation in my foot; this doesn't create added pressure on the calf. It is important to me as other higher compression socks in the calf area put stress on my MCL [slightly torn] on my right leg when worn all day. I will be ordering many more pairs for overall comfort. When I take them off my foot has no inflammation all the way up the ankle but does not squeeze my toes. Can't wait to try them skiing.Pros - clean easily in my washer on delicate and come out nearly dry; line dry in 8 hours at 69 degrees or less. Seem to be extremely durable. Thin top of foot and leg material dissipates moisture well. Price is reasonable [though varies greatly for extreme colors]. Their method for putting on a compression sock is dead on easy. Everything the company claims seems to be accurate and can't think of anything they are hiding.Cons - none I can think of...They do make others with high calf compression should you need it but not many others make this light of a calf unless they also drop the foot area too. This is an uncompensated review.",
        "I bought these before flying 3hours to attend a multi-day convention.  They kept my feet cool and fresh in a hot, humid climate and my legs were not sore after standing so much of the day.  I even laid them out in the hotel room and was able to ware them again for the flight home!  Not my normal plan, but nice to know it is an option.  As expected, it takes a minute to get them on, but then they were so comfortable I didn\u2019t even notice having them on.  After several washes they seemed to be holding up well.  Would definitely recommend.",
        "Bought these for Tough Mudder Dallas 2014. These were a LIFE SAVER and I'm glad I made the purchase.1. Size: I wear a 8.5-9 shoe size and these socks fit me perfectly.  They are super tight to put on, but once they are on, they provide a ton of comfort, especially around the foot.2. Comfort: These were very comfortable and not too tight. And, having ran the Tough Mudder, I appreciated that they stayed on my calves for the whole 12 miles without me having to pull them back up.3. Functionality: I've never used compression socks before, but I have to assume these things worked for a number of reasons. First, I am prone to severe shin splints. With these things on, I was able to run 12 miles without issue (and I can barely run a 5k). Second, I injured my toe on the very first obstacle, but the compression kept my injury padded and comfortable enough for me to complete the entire race and all obstacles. I wouldn't recommend doing it, but I think the socks actually helped keep the swelling down from my injury.4. Tough Mudder:  For those buying these for tough mudder, I'd have to say that in all honesty you probably won't need them if you're in pretty good shape. I bought these primarily to keep the rocks from getting in my shoes/socks during the run. And in that respect, it worked. While many other runners were taking breaks getting the rocks out of their socks, I was able to complete the race without stopping.",

I like the cool fabric, and the loose feeling, going down to the knees. Shrinkage will not be an issue, and the price for quality shorts of this kind cannot be beaten by amazon. I highly recommend anyone who wants a roomy and good looking and great fitting pair of shorts, get these, you will not be disappointed. The cool 18 pro pants are just as good.",

This seems to be corrected in other similar UA products. It's a good brand that usually delivers quality but this one kinda missed the mark.",

He  couldn't be more pleased at how soft they are but also how well they wash and endure many, many washings. Also my husband especially wanted the pocket on the shirt, which we was hard to find (not the shirt, but a tee shirt with a pocket). I've used many Hanes cotton products, and this one does not disappoint! This is surely an example of the old saying: An oldie but a goodie.",

        "My buddies have been using this poncho for years now and I finally broke down and bought one. They are extremely comfortable and versatile. I recently used mine on a 4 day camping trip, with rain for 3 of those days and nights. This poncho kept me warm and dry, it didn't get in the way of what I was doing. I would like to see just a slightly larger neck opening as I have a beard and it was slightly bothersome in the neck area. Other than that it was great. Folding up to go back into the integrated pouch was easy to do, and the small form factor when it's in the pouch makes it a no brainer to throw in the truck and leave it there for inclement weather. Definitely worth the money, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend one. I only wish I had listen to my buddies and bought one sooner!",
        "Haven't used my poncho yet in the rain so can't review it's waterproof ability. Mainly just tried it on for size as I am small (5' 4\") and wanted to make sure it didn't \"drag the ground\" when I wore it. It actually falls down to my knees (which is good). I bought this mainly because I've purchased many of Hazard 4's packs and bags and am really impressed with the quality of their products. I am also very satisfied with the quality of this poncho as far as stitching and hardware, i.e. snaps, are concerned. I'm pretty sure the thing will keep me dry. I bought it for my \"go bag\" so don't plan on using it. I've years of experience wearing a poncho in the army so don't see a need to try it out. It does fit easily back into the pocket for storage. Some have complained they couldn't get it back in the pocket. The trick is to turn the pocket \"inside out\" as that's how it goes back in. Just be observant when you first take it out of the pocket and you'll see how it goes back in. When it arrived, it is in the pocket and you have to take it out to put it on.",
        "Perfect for not only costuming use. I also use it for motorcycle camping shade and  bike cover.",
        "Overall 9/10! Excellent product, great materials and fitment. I have only 1 issue, and 2 suggestions after using it during these heavy rains and wind. My only issue was some of the stitching which came undone. As seen in the picture, I reattached using industrial fabric adhesive and to also reinforce the stitching in those areas.My 1st suggestion is to go to a triple stitch to provide better reinforcement with the most minimal increase to cost.My 2nd suggestion would be to add leg stirrups to the bottom. I made my own using paracord and cord locks. This prevents the wind from kicking up the poncho and keeps it nice and secure without impeding leg mobility.Other than those few minor things excellent piece of kit and worth the cost.",
        "The Poncho Villa, beside being terrifically well named, is the best rain poncho that your reviewer has ever encountered and he has been wearing rain poncho's in New England and Florida since he was a boy in the early 1950's. The Poncho Villa is made of a very high grade soft and flexible material. It has a large front pocket with both a zipper and velcro closing flap. The hood fits well. The front, back and sides have velcro areas where patches can be affixed. Finally, it's not too long, you reviewer is 5' 6\" and his girlfriend a few inches shorter; we both have Poncho Villas and they do not drag on the ground. We both love the Coyote color. This is a very well engineered garment and I would unhesitatingly purchase it again.",
        "Needed to purchase this poncho after running into trouble with a PVC/Nylon poncho.Nylon/PVC Poncho:1. NOT BREATHABLE - I was protected from the rain but became drenched in my own sweat while setting up camp.2. NO GROMMETS - without grommets it is difficult to keep the bottom from swaying with the wind exposing your legs to the elements.Soft Shell Poncho:1. BREATHABLE - can work hard with this poncho on and not work up a sweat.2. GROMMETS - can attach carabineers or Para cord to tie down for added weight or makeshift shelter3. STORAGE - folds into its own built in pouch for portability4. PILLOW - When folded into its pouch it can be used as A pillow ( its actually quite comfortable)",
        "Great material, construction and concept.  But the neck venting need to be more.  Since it\u2019s soft shell, that thing will build up a lot of heat if you need to be on the move so being able to vent out the neck a bit would make a big difference.  If you are just going to sit still and get pissed on, it\u2019d be fine.  But pretty snug around the head and neck.  Had to send mine back \ud83e\udee4",
        "I've been looking for a quality poncho (not Leo Carrillo). Most of the ones I've seen have either been made of something like a ZipLoc bag or a floor mat with holes in it. For me, most \"rain suits\" cause me to sweat to the point that I would rather just stand in the rain. To be honest ,I wasn't comfortable about the price but I eventually hit the point of \"Oh, what-the-hell\". It's worth it. It seems a bit heavy to wear but I personally prefer a garment with substance. It helps keep the powers of nature off my backside.",
        "Tengo un par de meses con este poncho. Y puedo decir que es incre\u00edble! Me ah salvado en varios ocaciones de lluvias intensas en campo. F\u00e1cil de guardar y sumamente pr\u00e1ctico. Alta funcionalidad y resistencia.Lo recomiendo ampliamente.",
        "upon browsing the entry for the Poncho Villa on the H4 website, an alert user would notice the bold claim that \"100% waterproof fully-taped seams throughout \" - this, after 20 minutes in moderate rain, proved to be a big fat lie. the seams are taped AND then stitched, handily adding perforations, I guess for breathability... really disappointed in this product. - 5 stars for customer service, as the guys were great!",

        "I'm always looking for tough pants that look like dress pants. These aren't them.They are more grey/blue than black, and they look more like track pants than dress or casual pants. If you have a uniform that requires black pants you can't wear these. Also they were very wrinkled and you aren't supposed to iron them so not sure how to handle that.That being said, they  are very comfortable, and if you are the type to wear sweat or track pants in public, these would be a step up.  They also seem pretty tough, but sadly I don't think I will get enough use out of them to put that to the test.If you want decent looking tough pants, 5.11 is the best that I've found so far.",

        "Great shirt for water aerobics. Not clingy",
        "Middle-aged dad here who has both gained some baby weight in the last few years and developed a big disdain for skin cancer. Bought this to wear at the beach this summer in the ocean for both protection and cover-up. Those six-pack abs are not what they used to be and I would like to lessen the slather of chemicals that my wife insists on rubbing me down with.* * THINGS I LIKED * *(+) Nice fit, somewhat tailored but not tight.  I did buy a 4XL when I normally wear a 3XL but that is because I didn't want it to fit like a wet suit top and show off all my beach-curves.(+) Nice material.. it is definitely synthetic, but after multiple all-day wears and multiple washings, it hasn't snagged or pilled and still looks great.(+) Good protection from the rays. Wearing it allowed me to reduce the chemical sun-block to just my face, head, neck, arms and legs, and believe it when I say that is a big improvement.(+) Great value for the price.* * THINGS THAT COULD BE BETTER * *(-) Not much, really... maybe better color choices? But all in all, it is a casual-style shirt that would work being worn into a food establishment.. it doesn't SCREAM beach style and could be tucked into dockers or canvas shorts for dinner.* * PURCHASE RECOMMENDATION * *Absolutely, buy a few in multiple colors.... you won't regret it and your skin will thank you. Totally worth the money.  Was in the sun for hours and had excellent sun protection as well as good wash-ability post ocean.  Salt water did nothing to the quality.  True to size, great fit and comfortable.  Also great at hiding that unsightly baby weight I gained through each of my wife's pregnancies.",
        "Fits very well and is very comfortable.  I'm 5'11\", 190 lbs.  The shirt is cut close to the body but loose enough so that it doesn't look like I'm wearing a wetsuit. There isn't so much fabric that it doesn't \"sail\" around in the pool either. A nice amount of fabric to hide my beer belly but not look like I'm wearing a circus tent. Definitely provides UV protection and I don't put any sunscreen on my chest/abdomen when wearing this shirt and I haven't suffered any sunburn yet.The material is a little thicker than the rashguard I bought from Target and this looks more durable at a lower price!  The stitching is nice and hasn't unraveled after near daily use last summer.  However, it has somehow slowly stretched in length somehow over time and it's a bit too long. The fabric does tend to \"hold\" onto the water a bit, so maybe that has stretched it a bit over time.  It does appear to dry relatively quickly once I am out  the water.  That being said, I've worn it a few times as an exercise shirt and worked OK, but definitely not a true performance wicking workout shirt.",
        "Light weight , comfortable fit",
        "Extremely soft, durable, great color.  Provides good UV covering, not too heavy.  Great price.",
        "I bought this shirt for my son to use while we were on vacation in Florida this year.  He really liked it, and had no complaints about it being too hot in July at the beach. It was a little big on him, and if I order it again I will get one size smaller.  The shirt dries quickly once out of the water. Very lightweight and he did not get sunburn.",
        "I ordered this for my 62 year old brother. He normally wears medium, so that's what I ordered. He was able to squeeze into it but looked like an overstuffed sausage. The arms & upper body were fine, but the torse was incredibly tight. It was nice and soft but I'm sending it back for a large.I can't really say if it provides any sun protection yet but will come back & update the review after we get the replacement & try it in the pool. He's got pale Irish skin & red hair, so he sunburns badly. I'm hoping this will offer protection.Adding on Nov 22, 2023: It does provide sun protection! The replacement arrived & fit him much better. He enjoyed swimming in the pool with my daughter & I over the summer & his body & shoulders never became sunburned. It was comfortable & soft, & it looked good on him.",
        "We paired it with red white and blue flag shorts. Fit great, stayed in place, perfect swim shirt for pool games. A little extra long and worked great.",
        "Very nice quality. Perfect fit.",
        "Hubby loved these shirts. Perfect fit and very comfy.",
        "Buen material y super recomendable",
        "After struggling with the fit of some of the more tailored swim shirts, this one is great. Comfortable and quick drying the Kanu Surf shirt was perfect. Ideal for someone in the larger category.",

        "240# 5\u201910\u201d XXL fits good with a nice looseness; an XL will fit snug.  This shirt is so light, soft, smooth and wrinkle free.  Best T-Shirts I have ever owned.  They wick sweat away and stay comfortable against my skin.  Might not be a great winter shirt but these are my summer mowing favorites.  The neck is generous and I have not felt a need to stretch it.  So far grease, oil and coffee have washed right out.  Did I mention how light it feels.  I was looking for a 100% Modal T-Shirt, I believe Hanes has a perfect blend and so inexpensive.",
        "I've tried many undershirts, and this specific blend of \"40% Modal, 35% Cotton, 25% Polyester\" is the very softest I've found. Way softer than any 100% cotton blends. It's perfect to wear lounging around at home.To make it feel even more comfy, consider getting it a size higher so it's not as tight.This is the one you've been looking for. Just buy it, you won't regret it.",
        "Bought these for our teenager. He immediately commented on how soft these are. For reference, he has a slender but athletic build (cross country runner), 5'10 and 137 pounds... and I ordered a Medium. It fits him true to size. The t-shirt skims his body, hip length and fits nicely throughout the shoulders. Washes well too. He loves these undershirts.",
        "Nice shirts. Longer in length so they stay tucked in.",
        "Classic white T-shirts are a must. I use these for sleeping and they are what I was expecting. Too often imitations abound; however, these are the real deal. Runs a bit small - size up.",
        "Hanes t-shirts seem to last a long time with less shrinkage than other brands... looking forward to wearing them for a good while...!",
        "I love when your item arrives on time. The T's are so soft and thick.  Will buy again.",
        "My boyfriend likes these T-shirts but I ordered XL, I always wash them before wearing but then I realized they were the wrong size so couldn't exchange them. Partly my mistake but they didn't pay attention and sent the wrong size.",
        "This fits well in a medium.  I always have problems with Tees coming untucked as my body is long but these are longer and do stay tucked in.  The modal blend is really comfortable too."

        "This is where I\u2019m going for all my colored tees now.  The tailoring and quality fabric are evident and for me that\u2019s even important in a t-shirt.  BRAVO \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb",
        "I bought for my husband who is in a physical rehab facility. He needs something that he can move around in comfortably, but still look decent.  This shirt does both.  The color is extremely flattering on him.  I have washed and dried in dryer and it comes out looking great.",
        "Been wearing for years. I wear xxl for bed time. Xl during the day with my jeans. I have almost the majority of colors. Heres some helpful details\u2026 almost every single color of these shirts is different in material and color than the pictures. The material on some of them is the true and trusted thickness and softness. Some material and colors are absolutely not. Thinner and more paper like and cheap. Colors are brighter on some. Muted in others. Some are cut boxier. Some longer. This is comparing same size shirts here. Its a hit or miss. But since I know which ones are always consistent, I tend to stick with those.The spruce green, light burgandy, denim, grape, pepper, and crimson coral type colors are great. I like the faded look to them. They are always thick and smooth in texture.  The rest are not. The black and navy color is boxy and cheaper in material. Which was disappointing because i love those colors.Couple more things to note: the large is too small for me. The xl large is a touch too loose. I wish that was more in the middle size wise. Also, if this doesnt say prime on it, you will get this from some vendor. This is a huuuuge difference in quality. For 90 percent of orders that fall into this category, ive gotten shirts that arrived damp and shipped with no plastic insert. Wrinkled. Some even looked like it was worn once. Not to mention they ship them out when they feel like it. So ive wait a week plus for them. I avoid those colors. Oh, and they never smell right. Just smells off..They also dont shrink very much. They get a touch shorter. Ive had these in a hot dryer too.I keep coming back for the material. Softness. Not shrinking and the awesome colors. But best of all these shirts are not short. They cover the butt.My favorite color by far is pepper and denim. They go great with jeans. It always looks good on anyone. It has a cool faded look to them and isnt heathered which I don\u2019t like. If you have larger arms and a wider back and want a loose fit and normally wear a large then get an xl. Otuerwise stick to your normal size.I also have about ten in long sleeve. Same review applies to those as well.Btw, im a woman and wear these. Womens tshirts are not cut right in my opinion. Lastly, if you cook in these shirts, somehow oil splatters show up even if you didnt cook with oil. I Cant explain this , but they dont go away with washing. I always wear an apron. Hope this reviews helps someone!",

I have tried lots of competing products, but keep buying these even though I couldn't be farther from the target skate/snow boarder demographic.  They're a good value, too.",

        "The socks feel soft along with some nice thickness and cushioning for the price. Like most clothes however, the shrinking of sizes while charging more is getting to the point of false advertisement. I bought these to replace my FOTL work socks which maybe fit a size 8 at best and are horribly thin. While a better quality (and pricier), they barely qualify as adult socks.

        "I love these shirts. They are true wash and wear and feel light and airy.After receiving once of these as a gift, I started looking for more and acquire additional ones  more whenever I could find a good variety. They are super comfortable and look good as well.I highly recommend them, but make sure to get the Tamiami II, as other versions of the same shirt (like the Bahama II) wrinkle badly after washing and require a lot of ironing.",
        "Columbia makes some fantastic shirts, but make sure to order the appropriate size.  I am 5\u201910\u201d, 195 lbs, and would typically wear a Large in most similar styled (button-up) shirts, but I have to get a Medium in Columbia PFG shirts.  (The Medium is still a moderately loose fit, as the Large is like a tent on me).  Tip number two is that because these shirts are on different sizing scale, many get returned to the Amazon Warehouse, so keep an eye for Amazon Warehouse deals on these shirts (see tips to finds the easiest way to compare prices across sizes and colors at the conclusion of this review).  I have tried the Tamiami II, Bahama II, and Bonehead (AND new Blood & Guts III \u2013 see below for updated comparison including the BG3 series) versions of the Columbia PFG shirts, and have been mostly pleased with all of them.  The Tamiami II was my favorite due to the cooling effect of the weave, but the similar Blood & Guts III is now right there with it.  Below I have noted the differences in these styles, for those trying to decide which shirt they may prefer.TAMIAMI II STYLE (POLY) - SUMMERTIME CASUAL FAVORITEThe Tamiami II (T2) and the Blood & Guts III (BG3) are my favorite of the aforementioned PFG styles.  The main difference between EACH OF these styles is material.  The T2 & BG3 are 100% polyester (liner and exterior), the Bahama II (Ba2) is nylon, and the Bonehead (BH) is poplin cotton.  The T2 is the thinnest/lightest (most breathable) material of the three styles, also has a slightly shinier appearance, and is probably the most wrinkle resistant of the three (as the fabric is less rigid that the nylon Bahama II or cotton Bonehead).  (Update 7/11/16 \u2013 The Blood & Guts series is also breathable polyester similar to the Tamiami with a slightly different styling, and stain resistant fabric.  See update at end of review for full comparison.)  The T2 has a snap button pocket on top with Velcro pockets underneath on both sides, which I also prefer over the pocket style on the other two (Ba2 & BH have identical pocket styles).  The synthetic T2 and Ba2 both wick moisture and create a cooling effect better than the cotton BH, but the lightness and weave of the T2 makes it by far the coolest wearing of the three.  For outdoor activity in the heat and humidity of summer, it would definitely be my preferred choice.  The long-sleeve version is fantastic for offshore fishing when lightweight sun protection is essential.  The Ta series also does not wrinkle as badly as the Ba and BH series shirts do.  (The PFG apparel which has an SPF rating, such as the Tamiami & Blood/Guts series, has an open fabric weave which is \u201close\u201d enough to allow some penetration of UV through the material itself; which means the material is much more breathable ergo cool feeling, although technically you could get some UV exposure through the shirt.)BAHAMA II STYLE (NYLON) - WORK WEAR IN MILD WEATHERThe Bahama II is the middle ground between the T2 and the BH.  It is synthetic - similar to the T2, but is a nylon exterior shell with a polyester liner (whereas T2 is poly liner and shell).  The pockets on the Ba are the same traditional Columbia PFG look as the pockets on the Bonehead.  The slightly more rigid feel of the nylon, also gives the Bahama a more traditional (cotton-look) appearance than the T2.  In a certain respect, the Ba nylon manages moisture better than the BH cotton version \u2013 i.e. it evaporates sweat more quickly.  On the other hand, the nylon does not absorb moisture, so in extreme heat with heavy perspiration, it gives the material a slimy feel that I do not enjoy.  The Bahama also wrinkles worse than any of the other PFG series shirts, so it is my least favorite series.BONEHEAD STYLE (COTTON) - COOL WEATHER FAVORITEMost everything has already been covered.  The BH and the aforementioned Ba styles look virtually identical.  Essentially, I like the Bonehead over the Bahama because it does not get that slimy feeling when you sweat, and it is slightly better from a wrinkle perspective.  The Bonehead is probably my favorite series when moisture management and cooling effect are not important, so I like these in long sleeve for fall and winter wear.  I also like the traditional appearance of the Ba and the BH for work wear, but the T2 look I like better for casual.  (The newer Blood & Guts series has the comfort of the Tamiami series, but has a look similar to the Bonehead, so it is my new favorite summertime work shirt.)  The Bonehead long sleeve also makes a great layering option for hunting season, and Sage is a great natural neutral (earth tone) color for this purpose.UPDATE 7/11/16 \u2013 BLOOD & GUTS III (POLY) - HOT WEATHER FISHING FAVORITEWhen this review was originally posted, I only contrasted the Bahama, Tamiami, and Bonehead series shirts, but recently I have found a new favorite \u2013 the Blood & Guts III (BG3).  While the name may not be all that appealing, these are really great shirts.  They have an SPF rating, therefore breathable/open weave, similar to the Tamiami, with a styling that more closely resembles the Bahama & Bonehead series.  The BG3 is also treated for stain resistance, making it a great shirt for fishing, work, and outdoor activities.  Finally, the BG3 does not wrinkle nearly as severely as the Bahama nylon or Bonehead cotton shirts do.  Out of the four PFG series shirts discussed, the BG3 series probably have the tightest fit.  I still wear a medium in the BG3, but the series has a slimmer type cut than the previous versions discussed.AMAZON PRICE COMPARISON & WAREHOUSE DEALSI used to always get aggravated at the way Amazon list apparel items with multiple colors, as it can take forever to search through multiple color (and size) options to see the cheapest offerings.  On my iPad version the color prices are displayed in a list style automatically, but on my PC desktop I would have to select each color/size to see the price options.  I did not realize there is a much simpler way.  Select the \u201cnew and used from\u201d (or \u201cnew\u201d if no used offerings available) icon, which will take you to a list view.  There must be multiple offerings for the exact size and color selected for this option to appear, so if you do not see the \u201cnew and used from\u201d hyper-link, then select another size/color combination till the link appears.)  In the list view screen, select your size and click the \u201clowest offer for each\u201d icon beside the color selector.  It will display the cheapest offering for each color shirt in that size, so you can quickly see which colors are the cheapest.  Also, this view will show any Amazon Warehouse Deals available.  As mentioned in the first paragraph, these shirts get returned often due to sizing issues, so many times the Warehouse deals are shirts that were tried on and immediately returned for a smaller size.",
        "My husband literally has this in every color.  He loves this because is breathes and is lightweight and it comes in the extended size he needs (XXL).  Plus, I like that it washes and dries well and no need to iron.  Great shirt all around!",
        "These are my favorite \u201cany situation\u201d shirts. Nice enough to wear out to dinner and rugged enough to wearing camping. I have a tendency to put out a lot of body heat so I love how breathable these are and how quickly they dry while wicking away sweat. They are a relaxed, looser, fit.",
        "I have reviewed other Columbia's shirts before because my husband use them in an almost a daily basis during summer time. I had gotten a quite variety of colors and designs for him. He loves them because they are really cool literally. He used to like more Under Armour , another brand but the price difference is almost 25% more for this other brand. The Columbia's shirts are really lightweight so keeping them in the lugagge is very convenient. I am comparing 2 kind of similar shirts, I saw another person who did it this way and is really efficient for buyers doing it this way.Slack Tide Camp shirts are made with the same material as Tamiami ii they both are really lightweight, they are sold as fishing shirts that I am sure are very fit for this but my husband has used them as a regular work office/field shirt. These shirts share the same design in the back but the thing I like the most is that Slack Tide's at the very bottom have a straight line so using them without tucking them inside the pants looks really nice. Tamiami ii has the classic extra lenght in front and back so using them outside the pants does not looks as cool specially if you used them for work. I believe for young guys this would not matter too much. Continuing with my descrption for Slack Tide's they have only one rather small pocket with no velcro, buttons etc. They do not have the traditional velcro base Columbia's logo in the front but a small tag on the pocket with the Columbia logo. This kind of shirts have a small loop/snare at the top button is not the traditional top button of all other shirts, still looking nice. Slack Tide shirts have, and is a very small detail but lovely, Located at the the front lower part these shirts has a small piece of fabric that according to Columbia' s decription its function is to clean one's sun glasses or just your regular reading lenses. This is very nice. This shirt is more fit than Tamiami ii. Size: important for many readers: the lenght is the SAME in both shirts but the size at the shoulders and middle area is BIGGER in the Tamiami ii. The buttons that Slack tide comes with have 2 colors with a predominat color matching the shirt's color. In contrast Tamiami ii has all them buttoms matching the color of the shirt. The neck collar on Slack Tide's has no buttons, in contrast Tamiami ii comes with buttons making it more straight. The colors are the same is not possible to get Slack Tide's in white for that reason I End up buying this Tamiami ii to complement his collection.Tamiami ii shirts are less formal, same materials, same coolness level in very hot situations. White or light color are somewhat translucid so it is advisable to use a t shirt underneath to avoid too much nipple exposee. The very nice thing of this shirt is the multiple pockets 2 of them been large and secure, help one to keep things and avoid loosing things. They both shirts comes with a mesh inside that help the transpiration process, or just simply drying faster after some rain, ocean mist etc. Because the material is poliester is not recommendable for any of these shirts either Slack Tide nor Tamiami ii to be around bushes or even close to non polished surfaces because they tend to tread easily. So I believe this is the reason for what they designed for fishermans. Tamiami ii quality is not as good as Slack Tide, besides that both are well done Prices are similar if not identical in both kind of shirts. I definitely recommend to buy them, I would keep buying them in the future but just to wrapp this up and finish my review my favorite one is Slack Tide Camp shirts. I hope this review will be usefull.",

        "These are slim fitting for sure, but fantastic for workouts and working outside. Really well made, not Chinese manufactured, and super comfortable. Good value. Highly recommended.",
        "I don\u2019t write reviews that often - but I had to for this. These pants are honestly my absolute FAVORITE of all time.I take them to work, airplanes, backpacking, to the beach, lounging, bbq\u2019s, literally anywhere it\u2019s allowed.They are unbelievably comfortable, form fitting, strechy, and good looking. I\u2019ve never enjoyed wearing anything as much as this. As a 6\u20191\u201d, thin guy I have a tough time with pants - but I just ordered another set for myself and more for family.Buy them. Period.",
        "As the title states, these are my favorite pants for the City or Country in all casual settings, I have a pair in almost every color and a couple of duplicates, just in case. They are the antidote to high-priced, baggy outdoor or outdoor-inspired pants. They do require a few modifications to make them work in this way. First, buy them longer than you need, so you can get them hemmed.  Second, you have to cut off that half belt at the waist. It doesn\u2019t work and is ugly. Use a lighter to melt the frayed ends. They\u2019re under the belt loops so nobody will see. Just get a belt or have the waist modified to fit you better. Second, cut out the terrible bungee at the ankle. The toggle is on the inside and hurts. Once you\u2019ve pulled out the bungee and the toggle, take the pants to the cleaner or tailor or your mom and have them fold the existing hem and sew a new one and mod the waist if you want or need that. Then you\u2019ll have a pair of outdoor pants that to the naked eye look just like a pair of chinos. They\u2019re so lightweight that they\u2019re perfect for fishing or high sun activities where you want to stay cool, but need coverage. Quick dry and pack down well. They do need insulation to be warm so consider some thermals in colder weather.",
        "I\u2019m a high steel/production rigger and this line of pants are my new favorite. Keeps me cool and drys fast after a downpour. I don\u2019t even look at other pants anymore.",
        "I'm Asian, 5ft 7in, 154lbs, waist 31.5\" and bum 37\". Size 30X30 fits really well with me, slim fit makes you look very  sharp and  also very comfortable. I'm able to squat without feeling ripping the back of the pants. One thing, the inseam is definitely much longer than specified 30\". If you have long legs, it shouldn't be a problem.",
        "Nice style and acceptable fit, but pants ripped after about four hours of wear. My other Wrangler pants lasted much, much longer.",
        "5'8 175lb athletic build. Size 30x32 is literally the perfect fit for me. I've never had a pair a pants that fit this good and I'm about to buy multiples lol will wear them backpacking this weekend so we'll see how they perform. But they are super lightweight and the right amount of stretch.UPDATE: Wore them on a 15 mile hike in humid 83 degree weather. they aren't the most breathable pants but they are way tougher than I expected. about 2 miles of the trail was basically hiking through briar patches. Trail was barely visible with how dense the thicket/briars were and the pants held up perfectly. No tears or fraying. Definitely recommend these.",
        "I bought them for cycling when you need more than just shorts.  I was in between sizes and went a size smaller, but I wouldn't do that again - the integrated belt would allow you to size down if needed.  The clasp on that belt is great, as is the adjustment, so even though I barely got the button on the pants buttoned the belt held it all together and gave me confidence the pants wouldn't unbutton mid-activity.Wore these on a 2.5hr ride up and down a mountain, and shockingly I did not sweat through these nor was I cold on the descent.  It kept the wind and sun off me while my friend only wore shorts and had to deal with that.  I don't know how, my only guess is my sweat wicked to the pants and then evaporated very quickly because my chamois was damp, as expected, but the pants were not.  And of course I sweat elsewhere.  Very impressed, I'm actually thinking I'll be wearing these in warmer temps than I thought to help keep the sun off.They also have a cinch by the ankle to keep the pant leg opening from getting in the way.  The material is durable enough like any \"adventure\" pants.  If these had a cycling brand name, or some fancy outdoor brand, they'd probably cost 3-4x.  I'm already thinking about another pair one size up...",
        "I'm very picky when it comes to attention to detail and fit as well as looks. These pants are 10/10 all around. I wear them rucking and they keep me cool. Definitely worth the price.",
        "Muy c\u00f3modos",

Did I lose weight am I a 29?Well, after following Wrangler's size and measurement chart I ultimately went with 29x30 being a little nervous that they would be too small but they are P E R F E C T!I mean I think these jeans should be the standard for sizing. They just match up exactly to what they say they will.If you are worried they will be too short, don't worry, these are like the first pants in history to actually match up to what the size chart says.The quality is amazing, as expected with Wranglers and I got them on sale so I couldn't be happier.First pair of jeans in 20 years I've purchased that I actually liked.Thanks Wrangler!",

        "Top quality underwear that fit true to size.  My last purchase of this brand seemed to run small but these are perfect. The cotton is soft and well made.Update: I made another purchase of these underwear.  My last purchase is in still like new condition.  The Quality of cotton used is heavier weight than any other brand I've purchased.  I will stick with 2XIST . Quality underwear.",

        "(+):  Great everyday comfort; I wear them for work.  Waist band is a nice fit, not overly snug or too small.  Cotton material is of a nice weight and it supports well.  Holds up to machine washing and drying.(-):  Design/fit is less than flattering, they do get a bit stretched out by the end of the day, so they look saggy.  If you're more into CKs, then these won't be your top choice.  If you're looking for an upgrade from FTL, Hanes, etc. then you'll be quite happy.  But the rear always seems to have too much fabric.Overall, good comfort and a better fit and style than typical men's briefs.",
        "For years my husband favored FOL hipsters but they finally gave up the ghost. My attempts to replace them for him were futile as the FOL replacements are now cut extremely skimpy with a very shallow front pouch. I suggested this brand and style to him and he has been a very happy camper ever since then. Though he is slim waisted ( 33\u201d jeans) the size large 2exist fit him perfectly. They wash up beautifully, he\u2019s comfortable and appears to feel confident strutting his stuff. \ud83d\ude0a",

If you\u2019re buying the three pack with black, charcoal and grey, the sales picture shows the grey with a grey waistband. But what you\u2019ll get is actually a black waistband. If you are wondering.",
        "Got the 3-pack and tried them on.  The material seems fairly good, they are generally comfortable except for one thing.  I'm 6' tall and about 180lbs, the leg holes are too small for me, its kinda tight on the legs but I'm only a 32/33 waist, so the Large would be too big for me.

Seriously.These Lee cargo shorts are my all time favorites because they have a bit of stretch in them (especially in the waist) and are the perfect length for me. The fit is true to size, no need to size up or down. They\u2019re roomy without being overly baggy, and the material breathes well. There are plenty of pockets for stowing all kinds of things, from phones to tools to snacks to more snacks to even more snacks. Only problem is certain chocolate snacks might melt in the heat so maybe don\u2019t stow those in your pockets. Just a suggestion.So yeah. Great shorts. A solid value for any dad looking to keep his dad card.",

I love wearing cargo shorts, I love the pockets so I can store my wallet and phone and not have them bulging or hanging in a rear pocket or sitting awkward in a front pocket that is uncomfortable. So many brands only offer plain colors -- how boring. This is my second pair of Lee's with a stretch waistband that is not too tight and actually provides a nice snug fit. I love them and will continue to look for more if they offer other designs.",

The biggest bonus for me is the phone pocket adjacent to the right side cargo pocket. I don't have to open the cargo pocket to get to my phone... just slide it in, and slide it out. I really think I will be ordering more colors...",

My only complaint is that they kinda cheaped out on the velcro on the cargo and rear pockets. I wish they had used more or bigger velcro patches. The drop pocket behind the cargo pocket on the right leg fits a Galaxy S9+ with room to spare, so bigger phones will fit just fine.All things said, I would buy these shorts again, and I probably will.",

        "Bought this as a gift for my dad. Tried it on myself and was amazed how comfy it was. It is also very warm and surprisingly lightweight. I'm 5'10/195lbs and the XL fit perfectly. I will definitely order this jacket for my next personal hiking jacket",
        "Well made! Not too loose and not too tight fit. Keeps user nice and warm in cold and damp weather.",
        "This is absolutely the best winter coat I\u2019ve ever owned , it\u2019s extremely warm. Hood is perfect and filled with warmth and puffy not just fabric.I\u2019ve worn it this last week in minus 25 below zero temperatures and wasn\u2019t cold once. Only wearing a long sleeve shirt underneath.This coat has a fantastic zipper as well. Not cheap china stuff.I bought the 3xl and it\u2019s just a titch to big but not enough to complain about.If you live in a cold area and have horrible winters like Wisconsin does this is the right choice. If you live somewhere with mild weather it\u2019s probably too warm. Very well made and I\u2019m extremely picky about my products. Thank you Tommy for still making great products",
        "This jacket is very warm, it is currently -10\u00b0 in Minnesota and this jacket had me sweating when I was outside today. This jacket has a non-detachable hood which I thought I would not like but I actually love it. If you need to flip this up it'll keep your head warm instantly. The jacket is water resistant and wind resistant which really helps keep the cold out. I would highly recommend this jacket for anyone looking for a warm coat in a cold climate. Tommy Hilfiger hit the mark on this one. If you're on the fence on this jacket and you want something to keep you warm, look no further cuz this is it. AAAA++++",
        "This coat is nice looking and decently warm but the sizes are actually bigger then what's listed. I ended up giving it to my uncle who really like it, but it was way to big for me to wear. I'm 6'2 230 pounds and a 2xtall was huge and to bulky. I will consider getting a size smaller next year and see if it fits better. I ended buying a carheartt insulation coat and that product was true to size..",
        "This lightweight winter coat is warm, and stylish. It is true to fits and quite comfortable. Very reasonably priced and the great value. Quickly became my go to winter coat.",
        "I hate buying clothes online. I needed a heavy jacket quickly so I purchased. I love it, it looks great, fits well and is worth the price. I would buy again",

        "Good insulation keep him warm and fits good",
        "The Tommy Hilfiger men's winter puffer jacket has proven to be a reliable and stylish choice for staying warm during the colder months.

Most of the time I need to order up in size to have the length, but have to rely on the drawstrings to keep sweatpants up. These Under Amour are easily my new favorite \u2018soft pants\u2019. The waist for size small fits perfectly and they are also plenty long so that I\u2019m not wearing floods. They also are relatively loose fitting, and have straight leg openings. Which is my preference\u2026 Under Armour please add zips to the front pockets and a back pocket, and I\u2019ll buy 10 more pairs!!!",
        "I bought these in a different color for my son for Christmas last year and he really liked them so I bought them for him again this year. I bought black last year and my son has worn them frequently. This year I bought charcoal.. The L fit perfectly as expected.. The black pair held up well and still don't look washed out, and the elastic has held up. They were worth the money spent. Great present and what I expect from the Under Armour brand.",
        "Pants are a little longer than expected, other than that, very comfortable!!!",

        "So I\u2019m 185 and 6\u20193 and these are so comfortable and love that they don\u2019t have the cuffs at the ankles like a lot are doing. I wasn\u2019t so sure at first with price thinking just another under armour product but I\u2019m happy I got these and are probably some of my favorite sweat pants.",
        "So I\u2019m an double leg amputee and I love these because the legs are roomy for my prosthetics and there\u2019s no elastic around your ankle which is a pain for me as an amputee. I like the way the open legs look better too. I would buy them again.",

        "This is the most awesome jacket that  I have ever had in my life!!!It looks 100 times better in person than it does in the pictures. It's like one of those pieces of clothing that you instantly fall in love with when you see it.Almost everyone gives me compliments about my jacket, all my family, friends, coworkers, and even strangers!!! I've never owned a piece of clothing where I got so many compliments before.I have owned a lot of jackets too, from 300 dollar leather motorcycle jackets to popular name brand jackets, and this jacket beats them all, and also has gotten the most compliments from EVERYONE!!!Without the hood, it looks like one of those cool futuristic GQ jackets with the popped up collar.A jacket like this would be worth 200 dollars at Macy's or something, and I feel like I got more than my money's worth.The jacket is really heavy duty. It is made of a canvas type of fabric, kind of like school backpacks, and it has some kind of water-proof layer on the underside of the fabric. Most jackets are made of plastic, leather or cotton/wool fabric, and I have never seen any jacket made of this canvas type of material before, which is really cool and unique.The jacket has some weight to it, but it's not super heavy. It also has tons of pockets, like 10 pockets total.It keeps me warm in 20 or 30 degree weather, and I can't even feel the wind at all. My co-workers were like \"He's walking around like it's a nice day!!!\", which is what it felt like to me, even tho it was 30 degrees outside with freezing cold windchill.At work in a super cold warehouse, I just wear a t-shirt underneath this jacket, with long johns underneath my jeans, some gloves, and a hat, and I am super toasty and comfortable all day.I wear my jacket at work all day everyday, in a super cold warehouse where I am driving a forklift, and lifting boxes, and stacking pallets, and I have also put the jacket through the washing machine multiple times, and it is holding up really well. There are no damage to the seams, no tearing, or cuts, or pilling, and no damage to the drawstring clasps.When I was reading all the reviews before I bought the jacket, I was worried about the seams tearing, or the drawstring clasps breaking, but I didn't have any of those problems at all. I think those people were just unlucky.And also the drawstrings, and the drawstring clasps on my jacket are grey, instead of black like in the pictures of the bad reviews. I think they must have fixed it or replaced it since those old reviews were posted, and it is 2020 now.The drawstrings goes around the very bottom inside of the jacket, like around the waist, and I never use it, and I don't think most people would ever use it, unless they were in Antarctica or snowboarding or something.I actually think this jacket is way way BETTER than those shiny plastic puffy looking North Face jackets. And this jacket cost a lot less too!!!I rate this jacket a 10 out of 10. And if you are thinking about getting it, then do it, you won't regret it.P.S. The jacket runs a little big, so if you normally wear a medium, and like your jackets to be more slim fit, then order a small.",
        "Very well made, good design, lightweight, warm, for a very attractive price, a comfortable winter jacket.",
        "I bought it as a spare rain jacket. Now it\u2019s my go to rain jacket. Absolutely love it. Great fit. Warm but it doesn\u2019t overheat you. Comfortable to wear, looks good. Very durable. I have had it for a year. I paid 74$ for it. I say grab it now for a lot less.,.",
        "I really like the design of this coat in lots of ways.  It's warm, the outer shell is tough nylon material that seems waterproof so far, there's every kind of pocket you could hope for, it fits me well.  Not a technical coat for climbing mountains or ski-ing, but perfect for walking around town in unpredictable conditions.  And the reflective strips are great.But ... the lining material is very thin, and within a couple of months it's fraying in places.  The loop for hanging it up is only attached to the liner, so that pulled the liner apart already.What can you expect for $65 or so ?  It's good value, and they had to save money somewhere, and it will be ok for a couple of seasons.  It just won't hold up long.  And that's a shame because the rest of the design is brilliantly thought out and functional and comfortable.  If they improved the lining and made it an $80 coat it would be a total winner.I got the steel color, and it's darker than it looks in the picture, dark blue.",
        "I live in the Midwest, where the weather can be super unpredictable. I ordered this coat when the weather forecast temps in the teens and wind-chills in the negatives. I only owned a super lightweight hoodie and was definitely hoping this blind buy wasn't a waste of my money and that it would at least keep me half way warm. This coat surpassed all of my expectations! Not only is it a decent weight, the fit is spot on. It has kept me warm in single digit temps, shields the wind, and repels the rain. If you're looking for a coat for the winter months, I absolutely recommend this one! Well spent money, indeed.",
        "I've had this jacket for 3 years. It still looks like new. It is very warm, firm on the body, all zippers are great still, generous pockets and good look. It is definitely a high quality jacket.I am 5.9, 186lb, and a medium fits me well",
        "2nd jacket; love the fit, lots of pockets, warm on cold days and rainy days",
        "I live in the Midwest so it gets quite cold. It definitely keeps me warm in -20 degree weather. I also love the pockets, very stylish looking, and for the price you can\u2019t beat it",
        "La compr\u00e9 para un viaje a Canad\u00e1 en invierno y de verdad cumple con lo que promete.",
        "Bought this for working in Quebec, area quite cold. Found when real windy I could feel the cold a little, otherwise this parka is warm and comfortable.  Quality is very good.  Zipper heavy duty and works well. Has reflective strips which are a bonus.  Lots of pockets inside and out.  Very happy with it, and worth the purchase.",
        "My husband has yet to wear, he\u2019s tall, 6\u20192, and wanted to wear layers under, he got the 4X. He\u2019s a big guy, broad shoulders. It\u2019s more than enough and he can wear some layers under.So far he\u2019s very happy. Let\u2019s see how it does in -40!",
        "This jacket is well constructed and heavily layered for very cold winter temperatures. The zippers, snap buttons and velcro components are also sturdy",

        "Very breathable socks kinda thin so not sure how they would work for cold weather outside work? Best part of these socks is they don\u2019t constantly fall down and they are tight obviously this a time will tell deal but after the first week love them. I wear the timberland ag boss boots or what ever the newer version of those boots are called. They are essentially a square toe, cowboy boot that are composite toe type of boots I wear for work. I\u2019ve been wearing them for the last 10 years and those boots are un comparable to any other boot in my opinion and having these taller socks that don\u2019t fall down is amazing. I definitely will be a repeat customer. I used to wear dickies work socks and throw them away once a year because they would stretch out and fall down every 15 minutes. Only thing I could recommend that would be nice is if they were marked left and right foot I am one of those people that cannot stand having socks on wrong feet and bunched up side on your pinky toe, this would help while sorting socks, etc.",
        "I have several of these. They are my go-to sock. After months, if not a year of rotation, none have holes. The material is thick enough, but not too thick for hot weather.  They fit snugly like a compression socks. People complaining of holes may need to clip their nails.",
        "So I ordered these without looking at the reviews, after they shipped I looked at them and started regretting my choice unjustifiably. Wearing these socks for weeks I love them, especially for the price. People said they're thin, but they aren't really any more then than any other tube sock, plus they are a lot thicker around the base of the foot to help with durability. I never noticed any weird smell or any tears. I will say the moisture wicking isn't spectacular but it's not terrible either. I loved my regular timberland socks and these are just as good and very high quality. Maybe some people got some bad pairs but none of mine were bad and I'm sure you could return/exchange them for new ones. Also I am a size 12 and I got the XL and they fit great, not too big at all which it says L and XL are both size 12",
        "I have a growing teen... I've bought this brand for him, for what seems like forever bcuz they last forever. Hubby wears same brand different style. The fit was slightly off. I bought based off shoe size of course but they're Def a bit tight almost to an uncomfy level. I'll just buy the next size up next time but Timberland brand has not failed me by any means. Hubby worked outside for 5 of last 7 yrs... we live on the east coast with lots of winter/snow/rain... so I bought him everything from socks to jackets to sneakers... Def my go to for long lasting and protection from ALL the elements here in NH.",
        "For many years now my husband has only wore the Timberland brand socks.  They last for years, always have and I'm sure they always will.  I trust this brand and will never buy another brand for socks for my husband ever again.  I recommend these above any other style or brand for comfort, durability, and cost.",
        "I'm returning to buy more. They've held up perfectly for a year or so. Which is more than I can say about most socks these days. They are thinner than I originally expected, but do well in tactical style work boots.",
        "I stumbled upon these by accident when I was trying to purchase regular Timberland socks. Only these were available at the time and I figured it was just a marketing scheme on Timberlands part.  Upon wearing the socks I IMMEDIATELY noticed how comfortable and snug they were in all the right placed on my foot. This is ALLNi wear now for my boots and work shoes, normal socks just don't hack it anymore... I'm a true convert!!!",
        "Have had this socks for a bit but not the only socks I wear. They are comfortable but the heels on most pairs have ripped through.",
        "For the value its hard to beat this quality, these socks are warm, with good air flow and water wicking, not water proof. Comfy socks with good compression, not super tight, just snug. Made well, they take a beating in construction.",

        "I really like the cut & fit of this shirt, It is a light denim & feels great when you wear it. Wrangler quality so what more, has to be said. I normally wear a medium & this shirt fit me well. I am planning to buy another one but in a different colour.",

The Wrangler denim shirts are excellent quality, quite thick, and previous shirts have lasted for years. The overseas delivery was quick and the package arrived a day or two ahead of schedule. Can't complain about that."

        "Got the black n grey one, fits perfect and is very comfortable. Very pleased with the jacket, super soft and is just warm enough for Phoenix winter.",
        "Like most of the reviews said, these are well made, comfortable, stylish, fit well, and depending on when you see them, a great price and value!  I bought the red and black and grey and black.  Very practical shirt jackets!",
        "I recently purchased the Amazon Essentials Men's Long-Sleeve Polar Fleece Shirt Jacket on October 10, 2023, and I must say, I'm thoroughly impressed. This jacket fits like a charm, offers fantastic quality, and provides a level of comfort that's hard to beat.The fit of the jacket is spot-on, and it complements my style perfectly. It's not too tight, but it's not overly baggy either. The quality of the materials used is evident as soon as you put it on. The seams are well-stitched, and the overall construction is solid, promising durability.The standout feature of this jacket is its remarkable softness. It feels incredibly gentle against the skin, making it a pleasure to wear for extended periods. Moreover, it's exceptionally warm, making it an ideal choice for chilly weather. I've worn it on brisk fall days, and it kept me toasty throughout.In summary, the Amazon Essentials Men's Long-Sleeve Polar Fleece Shirt Jacket is a fantastic addition to any wardrobe. It combines a great fit, impressive quality, unparalleled softness, and exceptional warmth. I'm delighted with my purchase, and I would highly recommend it to anyone in need of a cozy and stylish jacket.",
        "This shirt jacket is warm, versatile, and comfortable to wear. I get a lot of compliments when wearing it. It is also easy to clean. Wish I bought several.",
        "I really like this fleece jacket. It is very warm, and the material is very soft. True to size, and comfortable. As with most clothing that Amazon puts their brand on, the quality is very good for the price.",
        "Fits well, feels good, and lots of nice pockets.",
        "So, as the title of my review states, this one is difficult to do. The jacket had a lot of good qualities about it...color was vibrant, material was warm, and it seemed sturdy. This also had a \"Try Before You Buy\" option, which was really good too, however; the sizing I would label as \"runs small\", cause when I put it on, it kinda looked like it came from Baby Gap. I'm 6'2\", 240(ish) pounds, and the waistline didn't really come close to my waist. The odd thing is that I've bought plenty of jackets off the rack, at the same size, that weren't Big & Tall, and they fit perfectly...I guess that's why I am giving it 3 stars. If you're thinking of buying one, I highly recommend using the \"Try Before You Buy\" option, cause you may run into exactly what I did, and be disappointed. Other than that, everything was good.",
        "I bought one of these and my initial reaction was that it wasn\u2019t quite my style. I already have a bunch of fleece jackets, some pull overs, and this one just seemed a little less sexy than most of the others that I have. So I gave this to my wife, and she wore it once or twice, but  it was too big for her.One day for no particular reason I started  wearing this again and I noticed after a day or two that it was extremely comfortable. It\u2019s nice that you can button it up when you\u2019re cold and unbutton it as it gets warmer. The side pockets are really hefty and you can stick your phone in there and other stuff. The \u201cbuild quality \u201c on this is impressive. The material is just the right thickness. It\u2019s a little too heavy to be called a shirt, I would call it a light jacket. I wear it mostly indoors, this would not be warm enough on a cold Colorado day outside. You could maybe run to get the mail but that\u2019s about it.Anyway, I fell in love with it  and I\u2019ve basically worn it consistently during the winter of 22/23.  It dawned on me the other day that I like this  so much , that  I really should buy another. Amazon was still selling them, and the price was so incredible,  I went ahead and bought one in several different colors. So I think I have a total of six of these now. For the price these just can\u2019t be beat. I\u2019m 6\u20184\u201cand about 240 pounds and the double XL fits nicely. It doesn\u2019t go really far below the belt level on me, but it goes far enough.I suspect your experience will be similar to mine, and you\u2019ll find yourself wearing  this all winter long.",

Estupendo precio y excelente calidad",
        "I bought this to wear as a fleece \"shacket\" for work, rather than their branded (embroidered logo) jacket that was useless to me outside of work.  We couldn't wear a black hoodie, so I needed to buy something that was warm, easy to (keep) clean, and looks neat.This shirt looks much nicer, has a ton more wearability, and the bonus is, it's a perfect cozy sweater/shirt for chilly fall days or keeping warm at home.  My wife loves how soft and warm it is, I'll be getting her one too.It washes well (I turn it inside-out, and hang to dry, and doesn't get staticky, which is a huge plus.I like the pockets, they're generous and soft inside.  There's flaps on the chest pockets, which I didn't really need... probably would choose no flaps if there was a choice, but not a huge deal.  The pockets are perfect for keeping the odd thing in at work as I walk around, and has usually eliminated my need for a waist pouch.The shirt was sewn well, with no messy stitching or loose threads, and buttons are all very secure.  Good choice of colours, and a reasonable price, especially compared to fleece from C*lumb*a, LL B*an, etc. (overkill for what I required)Get this shirt.  You will not be disappointed!",
        "La compr\u00e9 para regalar y ha sido todo un acierto. Talla correctamente y el color es como en la foto. Buena compra.",
        "Was looking for this type of warm fleece but in a shirt style - lots of other outdoor brands do similar but for 2 or 3 times the price. Had seen YouTube reviews of Amazon Essentials winter gear and they were always very positive so thought I would give this a try. It's a bit darker in colour than the picture indicates, but I prefer that. It's great -super warm, great fit, very soft, and looks good as well. Absolutely worth it for the price!",

Very lightweight and perfect for hot and humid southeast weather. Only worn about 10 times so can't speak to others durability issues. Fit is perfect. Overall I'm happy with them.",

        "I bought a pair that were on sale at the mall and loved them, since then I have purchased 2 more pair from Amazon.They are lightweight but are sturdy pants, I wouldn't rank them with Carhartt but they wear/move much better.They do not stretch out while working in them throughout the day.They seem to have a double stitch in most places and I have not encountered any tears or rips while working in them thus far.Only issue I have noticed is that I needed to buy a full size larger in the waist than all of my other pants. I found this out when I tried them on in person, every pair I bought with the larger waist has fit perfectly since then.",
        "The pants fit as expected,  as I previously bought several pair of the black color before the price went way up (seriously?)If you are  a school janitor or building maintenance person , or you just want to dress like one, this color pants are for you. If none of these apply to you, then I would suggest a different color.I returned these the day I got them, and based on the amount of wrinkling, and the non standard inner (sealed) plastic bag,  I would guess that I was not the first to do so.I hope they find their way to the right owner , which is not me.",

Just after Christmas, I decided to I wanted a navy blue pair Amazon had them in my size at almost 1/2 the price I paid at the store I purchased the 1st pair from.  The 2nd pair fit exactly the same as the 1st.  I 100% happy with this purchase.",
        "The pants fit great and I like the material but the seam came apart just below the zipper and I never really did anything strenuous to cause it.",

I walk 5 to 6 miles a day for exercise and they are working great. I wanted something a little warmer for winter and these are doing the trick. I will probably buy more.",
        "I cannot emphasize how happy I am to have found these. I have literally spent hundreds of dollars over the past year or two trying to find decent socks, trying all the major names, like hanes, fruit of the loom, etc, and every single time something wasn't right. Either they wore out after 1 wash, or they never fit well, always sliding down, or they'd immediately get stretched out and the elastic wouldn't work after the first time. But FINALLY, along come these Puma socks, and they're perfect! They're super comfy and soft, they have great elasticity, they do NOT slide down my legs constantly, they don't get little balls of material all over them, they just do what socks are supposed to do, without any compromises. I cannot express how frustrating it's been trying to find decent socks. I'm literally throwing away all my other socks and buying more of these, while they still exist... because as you might know, socks come and go like car models, so a year or two from now, they may be different, or gone all together. Just stop reading and buy these! You won't regret it!",

They aren\u2019t too thick that you\u2019re hot, and aren\u2019t too thin that you will wear them out fast. Good performance. Great value. Be careful cutting the package off!",

        "Very nice form-fitting, wind-breaking rain jacket that I used for a 2wk trek in Central Asia. It kept me plenty dry and warm on 50deg days. I especially like the inside liner that separates the skin from the shell to provide comfort. And the long length that covers the rear was a thoughtful feature that kept more of the body dry on rainy days.Not much improvement needs to be made with this gear, but if asked, I would redesign the bottom a little wider so that when I sit down with the jacket zipped up (I have a rather lean frame), it won't try to split open. I saw the stress that puts on the zipper so I'm careful to unzip every time I sit down. If a wider bottom allows unwanted air inside, the designer can add an elastic/adjustable liner that traps the air, a feature found on short ski jackets.With some care, I think the jacket will continue to serve as my go-to gear for a walk in the city or a an extended adventure.",

The draw strings have a little rubber nubs that hold things tight.Also it looks cool and fits as expected. It can fold up into one of the pockets for storage if you need to.A lot of people are saying these are fake and giving one star reviews. I honestly couldn\u2019t tell you if it was real or fake, but honestly if it was a fake, I wouldn\u2019t care. It does exactly what it is supposed to do and is worth more than the price paid when I\u2019m perfectly dry time and time again.",

It was a nice surprise that the medium fit pretty well especially around the waist.I love the Amber color.Although, I can't confirm/deny the claims that there are fakes out there, I feel confident that my jacket is authentic. Let me explain.The \"missing\" embroidered logo... It does not make sense to embroider a logo on waterproof material. You'd have thousands of holes to let water in.The omni-tech logo on the sleve/wrist... It matches the same logo on the  official Columbia website.My guess is that Columbia made these changes as improvements to the waterproof claims of the garment. So, If you get a jacket with an embroidered logo, I'd send that back as the NON-EMBROIDERED is the newer version... version 2.0 if you will.The bad:I dislike the velcro patches to cover the zipper. Pretty annoying when throwing it on/ taking off. COLUMBIA, just give us version 3.0 with a waterproof zipper and get rid of the velcro!I don't know how long this will remain waterproof on a hike in the rain.The good: the color, packable, semi lightweight (Medium size 377.5 grams), kinda stylish. A good budget backpackers rain shell.",
        "This takes little space in my carry-on and comes out virtually wrinkle-free. Rain rolls right off, and the tight weave breaks the wind effectively, yet breathes well. Quality construction - good investment.",
        "This is my second waterproof jacket from Columbia. The first one is serving someone else now as I lost weight and it no longer fit me well. This one is not the same material or style but it works very well and is just as fashionable (if that matters). I wore this jacket during the NYC 5 Boro Bike tour and managed to keep my upper body perfectly dry. Almost 5hrs on a bike in pouring rain and no water got in. I put the hood on my head under the helmet and kept my head dry too. I highly recommend this jacket. Only gripe is I feel it could use another pocket. Maybe on the chest.",
        "I was worried when ordering if the size be too large or too small. It was easy to order and fit perfectly. I am a bigger dude and while I am hoping to lose weight by my trip I wanted everything to be perfect. It is incredibly light weight.",
        "This jacket is awesome. There are a lot of reviews out there which claim that these jackets are counterfeit. Those claims are not based on facts. I actually have done the leg work and the jackets being sold on Amazon by Colombia are absolutely real. The jacket is very lightweight and at the same time it seems to hold heat in, so in that respect it's quite warm. I've actually worn this in 45 degree weather and it kept me warm and dry.",
        "Excelente calidad. 10/10",
        "Beau, bon pas cher ! Satisfaite pour mon conjoint.",
        "Es una gran compra me encant\u00f3, es muy c\u00f3modo y abrigados, ya lo pude usar bajo la lluvia y me mantuvo seco y c\u00e1lido. Lo recomiendo ampliamente, me gust\u00f3 tanto que compr\u00e9 otros 2 m\u00e1s.",
        "La talla me qued\u00f3 perfecto, al material es muy bueno y no deja pasar el agua aun en lluvia pesada",
        "Turn out the left pocket and pack the jacket in it. It's so easy to do and you can pack it like an unorganized animal. I'm 6'2 slim build and the medium fit me perfectly."

Impressed with the weight, thickness and SOFT.  Just got them, so will see in the long run, but so far our favorites to date, especially for the price.  Like the hood better, too, more to it, seems to fit around the head/face better & stay better.  Like the adjustable pull-cords at the bottom of the pants, because we usually prefer the elastic cuff.  The length of each is better/warmer, and they seem to be very good quality.  Will wash in cold and fluff or air dry to avoid possible shrinkage in waist/bands of each.  We really like them.  Will update as worn/washed",
        "I have always been a huge fan of pro club clothing. The reason why I choose pro club over any other brand is because of the quality  and longevity of their products. Just like the plain pro club shirts that I wear, these hoodies will last a long time. Not to mention, they are incredibly thick and warm, which makes it perfect for the winter. They are pretty stretchy at the bottom too and will stick to your waist to prevent cold air from getting inside. They\u2019re not just warm, but also very stylish and with this charcoal gray color, I can wash it many times without having to worry about signs of fading or discoloration. i should have ordered this hoodie sooner instead of wasting my money on overpriced Nikey and adidas garbage that become thin and faded over time after a few wash and dry cycles. I\u2019m not buying any other hoodie other than pro club from now on.",

Ordered these in Classic fit 33\" and they fit fine at the waist and crotch, but were very boxy and too wide at the leg for my preference and frame.  I returned them and ordered the Slim version in 34\" (1\" bigger waist just to make sure) and the fit was perfect!  A little stretch is nice and the inseam is great for us shorter guys. They look better than most of the more expensive brands I own. Bought specifically for golf and they are a little fancier than chinos / khakis.  Ended up buying 4 pair. Material is nice and they are a great pair of shorts for the price. Exactly what I was looking for!",

        "Premium Product.  Nice materials throughout the vest.  Pocket closures keep stuff from falling out.  Fit is snug for 2XL.  I usually wear XL but had to buy 2XL in this item.  Advertised as a \"concealed carry\" vest and does have a zippered pocket with provision for carrying and retaining a small semi-auto handgun or a revolver.  I would not want to try to carry a medium or large handgun in that pocket, the vest would look like you had a boulder in the pocket.  I tried to carry my M&P Shield and it seemed awkward to me.  But for a small 380 or 9mm it would be fine.  That was not my primary reason to buy this, just my opinion on the Concealed Carry pocket.  Overall a great value, I am very pleased.",
        "I wear it over my thermal shirts, I wear it over my hoodie, I wear it under my coat. Unless it's warm enough for shorts and a t-shirt I wear it every which way. I like everything about the jacket it's a good quality material, the inside lining is good, I have had this jacket for over 2 years now and have had no problems putting it in the washing machine, Like some other jacket's. I like the jacket have had no problemswith the jacket. Even has all the right pockets. And I'm a real stickler for quality. My one complaint about the jacket though is this. With the brand name of Ariat, and the price that I paid for the jacket. There should be no flaws in the stitching  and this jacket had a few flaws in the stitching, two spots where the stitchings didn't come together evenly, and two spots where the doubled stitch was not alined correctly, and more than a few stitches that needed trimmed up so yeah. So yeah like everything about the jacket,  but the bad stitching in spots. If it was a cheaper jacket I probably wouldn't say anything but yeah since it is Ariat, kind of have to. I just kind of expect a little bit better, because of the the brands reputation to quality, and for the money they charged me.",
        "Giving this stars, because my son loved it. However, it is not canvas on the outer shell, and there is no canvas involved. It\u2019s so light weight that I didn\u2019t think it would be warm, but he says it is and really likes it. Versatile as it\u2019s dressier than a \u201cwork\u201d vest. But if you need some thing that is canvas, and it won\u2019t rip, this won\u2019t be the best choice.",

I\u2019ve seen similar selling for 3-4 hundred. The 3XL fit comfortably over my 2XL khakis and the length is just right for a rainstorm. As if nothing was there when I put them on. The elastic waist is very comfortable. Couldn\u2019t notice any change in heat when on. A fine compliment to my Propper goretex parka and they fold easily into the included 5\u201d mesh bag and weigh practically nothing.",

I have only tried these pants once in the rain since purchasing them but it was raining quite hard and they kept me completely dry. If they can handle that then they can most certainly handle hiking. I'm 5'6 with a size 30 waist and the size Small Short fits perfectly. My only very minor complaints with these pants would be the no pockets and I find them a bit on the baggy side but these are meant to put on over your pants which is why they're on the roomy side.

        "Very pleased with these. They are very light, fully rainproof, they breath, and you can zip them up almost all the way on the sides, allowing for ventilation and making them easy to pull on and off over shoes. Each side has two buttons that keeps the leg together even if fully zipped up. So you can really finetune according to temperature. At the bottom you can even choose the cut, more narrow or more boot cut. Excellent design."

        "I've only worn these socks on one hike so far, but they worked beautifully to keep me from getting blisters (which happens very easily to my feet!). I will be using them on a longer hike soon, and will update this review if there are any issues. They feel good on my feet, and I love the way the seam is on the outside of the toe box, and not up against my toes. That helps a lot!Update: I wore these liners with socks on several hikes in Alaska in August: a 9.6-mile hike, a 7-mile hike, and multiple 3+ mile hikes. I didn\u2019t get even one blister, and I was amazed! That\u2019s never happened to me before. I swear by these liners now!! I won\u2019t hike without them ever again.",
        "I absolutely love these socks. The first time I ordered them I only got one pair because I wanted to make sure they fit and worked well. I should have ordered a truck load. These socks are fantastic. I have always had problems with my feet especially when hiking. I would get major blisters even on short hikes. I have not had a single blister since getting these socks. I still get a few hot spots on my heels but NO BLISTERS!, and that should be expected anyway. They also do a good job on moisture wicking and keeping your feet cooler, and the added bonus of drying really fast. I can even wear cheap Walmart socks over top of them and be just fine, wool socks are to thick for me, they cram my feet in my boots. Only problem with them is that they are white. :(  White socks and dirt do not mix well, but that is a very minor detail. I really have nothing bad to say about them. So, my advice to anybody on the fence about buying these, BUY THEM they are fantastic.",
        "They really do help keep your feet warmer working as a thin layer but can\u2019t get them white again after 2 washings.",
        "Apparently not everyone wears sock liners these days like they did in the ancient times when I started hiking. But when my dd was gearing up for her first hiking trip of any substance, I just couldn't shake the idea the the liner socks are the way to go. \"They\" say you don't really need them (at the sporting goods store where they didn't sell them.) But IMO if you want to do everything possible to prevent blisters...get the liners. These were very soft and light-not bulky in any way. The toe seams were flat and almost seemed (pun intended) non-existent. My dd wore a pair every day of her 8-day trek and said they were comfortable and easy to wash and dry.",
        "My daughter, a soccer player, loves these socks. They are thin enough to wear under her regular soccer socks and haven\u2019t changed the fit of her cleats. They definitely helped prevent blisters and also helped to keep whatever taping she has on her feet/ankles from shifting/coming off.  Somehow, they helped her cleats slide on easier too, even though they are under her soccer socks.",
        "I use these under my mid weight hiking socks to provide an extra slip so my feet don't blister and my feet stay dryer.  I am very pleased how these socks performed on my last hike up Mt. Katahdin.  10 miles total and no blisters at all.  The two pair sock combination works extremely well for me.  At the top of the mountain I pull off the hiking boots and within minutes my feet and socks were completely dry and ready to go again.The socks felt good on my feet, fit nicely and seem to be made well.  I abuse socks on my hikes and these socks passed all the tests with flying colors.  I am very pleased with my purchase and if needed will purchase again.Tom",

        "I don't do dress pants, but these are very comfortable to me. They fit perfect for my size and my girl seems to like them on me ;-)",
        "The material is not too thin but also not too thick. Feels good. The size also appears to be true to size and the waist , thighs and legs arent tight.Things I wish were different. Button is tight through eyelet, pockets are shallow, belt loops are far apart, and the inseem/crotch is tight; tight to the point where climbing into truck makes me think the pants will rip at some point.",
        "I always wonder when I'm buying the Store Brand.  For these pants, it was a fulfilling leap of faith.  The pants are sturdy weight.  They come out of the dryer crisp and pleated.  The measurements are true to size, and I am ordering more.",
        "Good product but  much longer than indicated. Ordered a 42/29 and they are easily a 31 inch length. Little short fat men like myself run in to this often. I can wear them but they look  sloppy.",
        "Overall, I have to say I\u2019m largely pleased with the Amazon Essentials Men\u2019s Classic-Fit Wrinkle-Resistant Flat-Front Chino Pant. They may not be the gold standard for men\u2019s pants, but they do offer several compelling features, making them a practical choice for everyday wear.\ud83d\udc56 Fit and Comfort: Classic Is GoodThese pants hit the mark when it comes to fit. They\u2019re neither too tight nor too loose, achieving a genuinely classic fit that works well for a range of body types. The comfort level is pretty high, making them suitable for an office environment or casual outings. They also come in Big & Tall sizes, a much-appreciated touch that makes these pants more accessible to everyone.\ud83d\udc4d Wrinkle-Resistant: Keeping It SharpTrue to their description, these pants are wrinkle-resistant, saving time on ironing and making them a good option for travel or long days out. They\u2019ve been able to withstand the pressures of my daily commute and still look fresh by the end of the day. It\u2019s a feature that elevates the convenience factor significantly.\ud83c\udfa8 Color Options: Versatility in ChoicesAnother positive point is the variety of color options available. I purchased two pairs\u2014navy and khaki\u2014and both colors were true to the online images. They integrate seamlessly with the rest of my wardrobe, offering versatility that extends their use beyond the office and into more casual settings.\ud83d\udc4c Material and Stitching: Quality but Could Be BetterThe material feels durable and substantial but falls short of the quality you might find in a higher-end pair of chinos. The stitching is generally reliable, but upon closer inspection, I found a few areas where the stitching could be more robust. While it hasn\u2019t led to any issues so far, it does make me wonder about the long-term durability of these pants.\ud83e\uddfa Care and Maintenance: Mostly Smooth SailingWashing and drying are straightforward, thanks to the wrinkle-resistant fabric, which truly lives up to its name. However, I did notice a slight fading of the color after a few washes. It\u2019s not a deal-breaker, but it\u2019s worth noting for those who prioritize long-lasting color vibrancy.\ud83d\udd0d Minor Downsides: Belt Loops and PocketsOne minor gripe I have is with the belt loops, which are a bit too narrow for some of my belts. It\u2019s a small issue, but one that affects the overall usability of the pants. The pocket depth is adequate, but they could be a bit deeper to ensure that items like phones or wallets are more securely held.\ud83d\udcb0 Value for Money: Almost TherePricewise, these pants are positioned in the mid-range category. While they offer good value for the cost, the minor quality issues prevent them from being an absolute steal.Summary and Final ThoughtsIn summary, the Amazon Essentials Men\u2019s Classic-Fit Wrinkle-Resistant Flat-Front Chino Pant offers a solid, albeit not flawless, experience. They score high on comfort, fit, and convenience, with the wrinkle-resistant feature being a particular highlight. However, they lose a star due to minor quality issues related to stitching and material, as well as the slight inconvenience caused by narrow belt loops and average pocket depth. Nonetheless, for the price point and the versatility they offer, these pants are a solid 4-star product that I would recommend to others, with the caveat of the aforementioned minor drawbacks.Thank you for taking the time to read this review. I hope it helps you in making an informed purchasing decision. If you\u2019re looking for a reasonably priced pair of chinos that offers a good balance between quality and convenience, these are a commendable option.",
        "The fit is great and the give in the waist is really good and comfortable - good quality and look sharp. Go with exact size...inseam right on the mark but for the price you could have hemmed if you can't get your size as price point excellent.",
        "I bought this pair as they looked good in the photos.I could not be happier with that decision. These pants fit well, very comfortable and stylish. The pants material are very durable and very resistant..I could not be more surprised with this purchase. As a matter of fact..im buying again in a different color.",
        "Compr\u00e9 3 colores: negro, a\u00f1il y gris, este \u00faltimo es el que tiene un color menos vistoso. La tela al tacto es suave, al vestirlo se siente ligera, muy c\u00f3moda. La talla es justa, mide tu cintura y pide la correcta, no m\u00e1s grande ni m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a. El corte es cl\u00e1sico, sin ser demasiado holgado, se ve casual o semiformal, depende que uses en la parte superior. Al caminar con el, se siente fresco, nada pesado. Al sentarte, hay suficiente espacio para no sentir como se adhiere o se estira. Si te gusta usar pantalones skinny, este pantal\u00f3n no es para ti. El precio es excelente, adquieres una prenda de muy buena calidad, con la que estar\u00e1s c\u00f3modo todo el d\u00eda.",
        "Great fit and value",
        "Good value at just under \u00a318 (on offer). True to size and comfortable fit, ideal for general purpose wear when taking dog for walk or nipping to shops. No issues with zip/stitching etc but time will tell. Material soft & comfortable, not unlike feel of denim/poly cotton. For general purpose trousers I would buy again at current price of less than \u00a320."

        "I ordered this, and two other shirts, and they all arrived. I bought 3xl large, not tall. Well, I swam in them. Sleeves were too long, shoulders too big, etc. So, I had to return the three, and buy 2xl (in Canada, I am a 3xl bordering on 4xl). So my advice to you men...buy a size down. But in saying that, these shirts are really wrinkle resistant, look decent, fit fairly well (sleeves are an issue, but they always are, so I don't fault the brand), and they feel so damned good on, not one sweaty neck in sight. If you spend too much time at the buffet table (or in my case, over a grill in the backyard), and aren't twelve feet tall, these are the shirts for you. Love mine, absolutely love them.",

        "Having some old worn out Hanes tank tops with holes in it, it was time for a new tank top. I didn\u2019t want the same boring look of Fruit of the Loom or Hanes. I searched on Amazon and decided to get this 2xist 2 Pack Square Cut Tank Top in the color black.What to like:What I like is first the design. Unlike my old Hanes, 2xist tank top has a great square neckline. This gives it a great look. Being 5\u201911 and 180 lbs plus this square-cut tank top fits perfect. Very fitted. I feel very lean and comfortable with it on.Another thing I liked is it\u2019s tagless. I hate it when any of my shirts  or tank tops have tags. Over time, that worn out tag will start to break apart and scratch the back of your neck. Not a good feeling.The quality is very good with 2xist tank top. I brought this in Feb. 2015. Having gone thru the washer many times, this tank top has held up and still looking fresh from the washer. Unlike my old Hanes, it didn\u2019t get or feel loose.The one thing that some people may not like is the price. Paying over $25.00 for a pair of tank top may seen very expensive. If your on a tight budget and don\u2019t want to spend too much on a tank top, you may want to look elsewhere.I personally enjoy this tank top by 2xist. 2xist Contrast Square-Cut Tank Top is one great tank top.  The design and comfort is why I bought this. I would definitely buy this again. Hope this review helps.",
        "Feels great and good fit",
        "I absolutely love these undershirts.  I will admit I am impressed and surprised by the quality - even after washing and going through the dryer.  These shirts remain stretchy and extremely well fitting.  Highly recommended, I just wish the price wasn't $30 for 2 pairs.I will be a fan of this brand for life.  I have grown tired of the inconsistencies and old ragged Hanes undershirts.Well done and well made!  Thanks 2(X)IST!",
        "This square cut tank is very comfortable and fits \"as expected\" -- I expected it to be a little tight in the beginning, then after a wash it loosens up a bit, and it doesn't give the 'man-boob' look that some of the these do (if it does at first, after a wash it should relax)Target used to carry a brand called Evolve, and that brand has now become 2(x)ist - I absolutely loved the Evolve Square Cut tank, and this is just a little bit different in the following areas:-the rib pattern is more pronounced (I think for the better)-the shoulder 'straps' are a little thinner (I think giving it a more old-school vibe - again for the better)-the material feels a little less sturdy and a lower quality cotton, but still better than some of the other brands-there is a small tag on the outside in the back (I think giving it a somewhat more modern flair - not thrilled about that)-the price is more expensive, but compared to other square cut's I've tried it's worth it",
        "Designer looking tank top, good fit.",
        "Being a bigger, tall person, I have issues with undershirts staying tucked in. These shirts are long enough that I don't have that issue.",
        "I'm a fan of the squared style that 2(x)ist is known for. I honestly like these shirts quite a bit, the fabric is nice, and it seems to be excellent quality. I only gave it 3 stars for one reason, and maybe I'm being harsh, but these shirts run waaay long. I have an athletic build, so I easily fill out the upper body of the shirt, no issue there. But the shirt runs all the way down to the bottom of my butt, it's annoying and a bit excessive. I'm sure it works well for those wearing these under their work shirts and tucked in, but I wear mine un-tucked... and for that it's just annoying. I'm going to have these hemmed up at the tailor because I actually like the shirts, they are just way too long. Unless you're tall (over 6') then it probably isn't an issue for you.",
        "I like the fact that when you buy them you get 2 in a package",
        "Calidad-precio.",
        "If you are a fit (muscular) man, this is a great tank to wear. Unique style also. You rarely see it.",

        "I have been using amazon consistently for 5 years and this is my first time writing a review due to these shorts. I have been in the market for new compression shorts for years as i've been stuck with the ones i've had since high school (gross I know) but i've been super picky and fellas you know what I mean, you have to be. I've gone through/returned so many and different brands as well because they were too small/too big/too loose/too tight/uncomfortable/etc. you name it. You need high quality compression shorts so you're not constantly adjusting yourself in the gym/on a run/etc. These shorts are super high quality, perfect amount of stretch on the waist line as well as the area protecting the goods, perfect amount of compression without being uncomfortable. These shorts are absolutely perfect and i'm super happy to finally be able to throw away my torn-to-shreds old pairs. (I am 6'4 240lbs)",
        "I got these to wear for when I go to the gym or running outdoors. They are really comfortable and nice and stretchy as well. They keep everything nice and tight and have a great compression to them. Would definitely recommend as they are high quality and well made and have lasted me quite a few weeks and workouts now.",
        "First off, these are top notch, have great colors, and feel durable. I put a pool in my backyard and decided it was time to update my 15 year old Walmart swim trunks so I visited a few websites and decided I\u2019d form brand loyalty with \u201cSalt Life\u201d. I knew I wanted the board shorts and didn\u2019t need another set of trunks with a net inside (I decided on Columbia shorts with the net). I prefer board shorts and they are so much more comfortable however I don\u2019t care for the lack of support and probability I\u2019d be the guy from \u201cFriends\u201d in the coffee shop that Phoebe was dating. Boxers underneath are an option but they take forever to dry and will inevitably cause an apocalyptic rash. So, I set out to find an alternative and decided on these. Low and behold they work perfectly and I now have a pair of these for every set of board shorts. These do increase the time it takes to dry unfortunately, but they won\u2019t wage war on everything sensitive and they dry faster than boxers.Update 9/17/2023: Just ordered and received a third pair of these. They are sure pricey but I love them still. Each pair is holding up great and still fit well.",
        "Purchased these for my son who prefers good, quality material that conforms to the body.  He has a 32\u201d waist and said the mediums fit perfectly.  These aren\u2019t the short boxer briefs but the ones that come to the mid-thigh.  Comfortable and breathable for all seasons.  Elastic waistband is soft, he said.  Does not shrink after a cool washing cycle and dryer cycle immediately after washing.",
        "great fit & durable",
        "I read reviews neurotically before buying, then decision fatigue sets in and I don\u2019t end up ordering anything. This is different. These are expensive, but I needed some good compression boxers for running. The best compliment I can pay is I ran 10 miles today and never thought about them once. Best pair I have owned hands down. Usually the stuff on Amazon is cheap, but this seemed to be an exception. Fit was perfect, comfortable, no problem with waist band. I want a few more pair now.",
        "I\u2019m 6\u20195, 370 and these are perfect. I can move freely and they feel good on my skin! Prolly not going back to cotton briefs and sticking with these. Def recommend",
        "I liked the leg length and fit, gives good compression for my workout.",

        "I was skeptical at first because I usually buy Marmot parkas not bubble coats. However the sale price, the additional 20% clip coupon and my gift card brought it down to about 83% off retail price.Only downside was that the XL on sale not L. I am a 42 and the XL is definitely an XL (44) The jacket is very warm in 29F degree weather with a hoodie underneath. I own a Yukon 2 Parka and a Mammoth both in Large but I was looking at another jacket for my rotation and this didnt break the bank. The Cilantro color is not to flashy and it feels very smooth. Its not to puffy either.My only complaint but is not a dealbreaker is a detachable hood. I like being able to remove and snap it back on depending if there is rain or snow, since I always wear a hoodie or hat.Final thoughts: Ideal for NYC weather, very warm and if it gets to hot you can zip open the buttom zipper. Nice texture, no feathers yet, true to size. Will consider buying more Stockholms in the future for gifts and the family.",
        "While the MARMOT Men\u2019s Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket II boasts impressive warmth and a sleek design, my overall experience has been somewhat marred by sizing issues that left me feeling less than satisfied.The jacket's insulation with its high fill power undeniably provides exceptional warmth, making it a reliable choice for colder climates. The down material is both cozy and efficient at trapping heat, ensuring I stay comfortably warm in chilly weather.However, the sizing was a significant letdown. Despite carefully following the sizing chart, the jacket turned out to be much larger than expected. The fit was boxy, and the excess material detracted from the stylish appearance I had hoped for. The oversized look was not the sleek silhouette I anticipated.Additionally, while the jacket's overall design is functional and straightforward, it lacks the tailored aesthetic I had imagined. The puffiness, exacerbated by the larger size, diminished the jacket's stylish appeal. It's unfortunate that the visual appeal didn't match my expectations, considering the reputation of MARMOT for producing quality outdoor wear.On a positive note, the jacket's build quality is commendable. The durable exterior and quality stitching are indicative of MARMOT's commitment to crafting reliable products. The jacket's resistance to wind and water is a notable plus, providing added protection in unpredictable weather conditions.In summary, the MARMOT Men\u2019s Stockholm Down Puffer Jacket II is a well-made piece with outstanding warmth, but the sizing discrepancies and unexpected appearance have left me slightly disappointed. If considering this jacket, I would recommend sizing down for a more flattering fit. While it excels in functionality, the style may not meet everyone's expectations, so it's crucial to manage sizing expectations before purchasing.",
        "I really enjoy this jacket. I am 6 ft tall, yet the XL jacket is longer than it looks on the model. The bonus is that its back is a bit longer than front. Also the hands in the pockets feel warm protected by a thick layer of goose down.",
        "Light weight and very warm and comfortable.",
        "Otherwise great.",
        "A very well-made, packable insulation piece.  No, it\u2019s not for the Polar Circle, so don\u2019t expect it to be overstuffed. My blue has a very slight sheen to it  -likely from the treatment to make it a little precip resistant- but it\u2019s not \u201cshiny\u201d.  The 700 fill provides comfortable warm and is appropriate for the intent of the jacket.  Low profile cuffs and detachable hood make it an excellent choice for a packable, bail-out piece or something to provide the light-traveling speed hiker a warm piece for days end around the Jetboil.",
        "The earlier version from last year had 3 pockets inside with metal zippers outside , veru warm; this one is a. crappy skinny coat with most likely imitation down ; 40F and not warm at all !!",
        "Compared to the top brands of winter outer ware, the Marmot puffer holds its own\u2026maybe it doesn\u2019t have the cache of other brands, however, this is a capable down jacket at a third of the price.  You will not be disappointed."

Now these sweatpants don\u2019t grab your ankle and hold on tight they are open somewhat. They are also well-made. I would highly recommend this product.",
        "Looks better in person compared to the photos.Super comfortable, not to tight, not to loose.",
        "Great pants that are priced well and very comfortable.  But, took a while to get the right fit and a pair without issues.  Order like 5 different pair in the same size to get the perfect fit.  They vary in size even when you order the same size.  Plus, had some issues with drawstrings being way too short.  Besides the lack of consistancy in the manufacturing and once I was able to find the right fit - they are very comfortable and for the price you can't beat them!",
        "I bought these for myself so they would be long enough. The material is soft and thick enough to stay warm and lounge in.",
        "Bought for son who\u2019s in college. These are on trend with tapered open bottom. More straight not skinny. Medium weight quality material. True to size.",
        "Like most of the world, during this \u201clockdown\u201d, I have become obsessed with two things: getting everything delivered to me, and wearing sweats, 24 hours a day. Both create problems. With delivery, you are at the mercy of those that shop for you. I\u2019ve given up on ripe melons and checking the cartons of eggs\u2026 and as for sweats, well, I\u2019ve worn out my several pairs, and have gone onto Amazon to find new ones. I\u2019m thinking that even when I finally am able to go out into the open air with actual interaction with other human beings, I may still wear sweats. Of course the hard part is finding sweats that have the essentials: pockets, a good waist band, and draw-string, and the most important\u2026 length. Once in the past, to my horror when I brought in my sweats to be shorten (as they all did), I find that I had to take out a second on my house in order to pay for the what the cleaners proceed to be as complex and expensive as open heart surgery. All this to say that for the first time, I think in my life, I have found a company that not only makes excellent quality sweats, but actually have a chart that gives you an accurate length. It\u2019s all about the in-seam, and no matter how careful you are with other company\u2019s (and yes, I always measure my in-seam before each order, since who knows when and if it actually can grow or shrink), the sweats are ALWAYS too long. And I don\u2019t mean just a little bit. I mean, it falls to the floor and covers your heals and half the bottom of your feet. Yes, you can get \u201cclosed\u201d bottoms, but all that does, since they are also too long, is they bunch up like pantaloons\u2019 and still, even with the elastic  bottom, they also slip down under your feet after time, and after a few washings what little elastic  there is in the bottoms are gone. So again, to my shock, when I got these Southpole Men Basic Jogger Pants (fancy word for \u201csweats\u201d), I was first impressed with the quality of the material and the construction, but what truly made me freak out in happiness, is that, as promised in their chart, the bottoms fit exactly where they should! Just to the middle of my ankle! And this was even with the pants pulls not up above my chest, but when I had then hanging just at the waist, where they should be. Hallelujah! Yes, amazing. I quickly ordered another half dozen that should last me through the end of the world. If you want sweats, or \u201cJogger Pants\u201d, that are prefect in every way, especially in that the length is where it should be\u2026 buy these. In bulk!",
        "I was going to orders large but Amazon stated I should order xl.  The X-Large is too big.  No elastic around ankles. Comfortable but hope they shrink. Average at best.",
        "Great fit, ope bottom, easy to put on, two draw strings for a snug fit",
        "They are comfortable enough, but they pilled immediately around my thighs and the fit is for someone who is generally larger than me. Would not recommend and would not buy again.",
        "The pants got super fuzzy (pilling) on the first wear, material feels cheap. Wouldn\u2019t recommend. Even though these were purchased for lounge around the home they looked so gross after the first wear that I won\u2019t wear them again.",
        "Nice fitting and very comfortable. I'm very glad I got these.",
        "Overall decent for the price. They do pill after wear and can see dark colours through them. But still good valued comfortable. My son wear me them often.",
        "I bought 3 pairs so far xxl fits me perfect and I have  35 inch leg very little shrinkage in the dryer and always dry on delicate with your darks"

        "Absolutely love this coat.  Very clean and professionally made.  Excellent look that is comfortable at the office.  The texture is really nice too, both the lining and the surface of the coat.  I've had a lot of coats ruined by an awful fur/textured neck lining, but this one is just smooth fabric like the rest of the coat.  The zip-out liner makes it truly versatile.I'm not sure if you're supposed to or not, but I also ran it through my washer/dryer without incident.  The cut and fit are accurate, I just got the same size that I wear for a suit coat.  I suppose you might want to go a size up to wear this over a suit.  Has held up well in the rain too, even after washing!",
        "For the price, this coat is truly high quality! As some have mentioned, this coat runs slightly big. Not to worry though. I found that if you go one size lower than your normal suit size, it should fit just right. For reference, I bought a 42R, despite normally wearing a 44R.In addition to being a more than decent rain coat, it's also surprisingly warm. You'll be able to wear this in the winter with no problems. Highly recommend this one to anyone in the market for a decent trench coat at a fair price.",
        "This coat is a classic style - meaning it\u2019s cut generously. I\u2019m 5\u201910\u201d and 170 pounds. Typically, I wear a 42R suit. I was swimming in the 42R coat. Returned it and switched to a 40L and it fit perfectly. The chest and shoulders fit just right, including over a suit jacket with dress shirt. The Long allowed me to have sleeves that weren\u2019t too short for the smaller size (I wear a 35\u201d dress shirt sleeve).  Length goes to just above my knees.I really like the simple style but with classic features like the zip out lining. There is also an inside zippered pocket along the left side. The other bonus is that it\u2019s machine washable. Really glad to find this coat on Amazon. Nothing else like it in brick and mortar shops and certainly not at the great price offered online.",
        "I will be traveling soon to a cold and rainy city.  I have not tested it for permeability, but it is a good design, it fits well, and it is comfortable.",
        "Great coat for any weather conditions. Zip out liner is easy to remove and put back in. Coat size is a bit large vs expectations but not overwhelming and allows for layers if needed. Cozy comfy fashionable very functional",
        "Nice coat, nice fabric, quality build. The coat runs large; I ordered a 40L - I wear a 40L slim fit in suit coats - the London Fog was to large and bulky. Exchanged it for a 38R which fit me correctly with a suit. If you have a big stomach-mid section then your regular suit size would probably be the correct coat size. If you are trim and fit then I recommend going down one size. The coat has a nice zip-out liner. The overall look is simple and stylish. I pair this with waterproof dress shoes and a decent umbrella for my 2 mile walking commute to and from work here in NYC.",
        "Coat fits true to sizing: I\u2019m 5-11, 185 with an athletic build & LARGE fits great; nice zip-out lining-perfect for all seasons; classic, well tailored look with a soft, plush outer fabric found on high-end outer-ware. Colors are soft. I picked an olive green-good choice if you want something off standard.",
        "My husband purchased this coat as a Xmas gift for my son, and he loves it! The coat has a zip out lining that is also very warm. Do consider getting one when it is on sale as he did.",
        "It\u2019s good value and well suited for a west coast winter. I found it runs large. The 40R size worked for me - I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d, 185 lbs, 42\u201d chest. Enough room for a blazer underneath. Very happy with purchase.",
        "Tanto el dise\u00f1o, como los materiales y acabados son muy buenos. Aunque est\u00e1 hecha en China, se nota cuando hay un correcto control de calidad por parte de la marca. Una prenda magnifica",
        "Good quality",
        "La chamarra fue un regalo y le quedo muy bien.",
        "Like that it will fit over suit jacket, very roomy, great fabric for a raincoat.  The olive colour is pleasing even though I usually choose navy in the darker coats.  Zipper for liner works well, the buttons take getting used to as they fit tight.  Style is simple but cut elegantly.  The quality is higher than I expected."

If you like your shirts to fit big, i recommend you get your true size in this shirt. Material is amazing. So soft. Makes me feel like a million bucks. Im probably going to get another color of the same shirt. Lots of compliments.",

This shirt lets a good amount of air through without compromising on the looks. It definitely keeps me cool and I enjoy knowing my skin is somewhat safer from UV rays. I take this shirt fishing and camping and it works great in the hot conditions. It also dries extremely fast so for example, I will rinse/wash this shirt at night when camping and hang it up. By the next morning it is dry and clean.Definitely try this shirt on in a store before buying. I am 6' 1\" and 205 lbs and usually wear a size large shirt. I was able to fit in a small size, although not very comfortably, when trying it on at Sports Authority. I settled on the Medium because I felt it fit me perfectly. I ended up getting this shirt for 30 bucks with Amazon Prime, it was priced above $45 at my local Sports Authority.I would definitely recommend this shirt to anyone interested as long as you try on some different sizes in a store before buying online.",
        "All the Columbia shirt models fit me differently. Like the fit on this model the best - I'm 6'3\" and about 230 and the XL seems perfect. These are well made, super comfortable fabric.

The XL is more comfortable and allows for layering in colder weather.However, for the (sleeveless) vests, I prefer the Large for a snug  but comfortable fit.  As others have noted, Amazon basics do not have adjustable drawstrings to tighten the fit.  As such, the XL vest is too loose to wear as an inner layer.The vests do keep you warm and are of good quality.  Lightweight synthetic fiber with a water resistant nylon shell.  If you can buy the vests on sale, it is a great value.",
        "I bought a medium size and it was way too large. I returned it and bought small\u2014perfect fit!  The small fit like a medium should have.  It is comfortable and looks great!",
        "Gave as a gift to dad. He says it feels great. True to size. Comfortable and keeps him warm. Good purchase for the price.",
        "Great light -weight but warm vest. Perfect to wear under another jacket or by itself. Very happy with this purchase \ud83d\ude03.",
        "We love it, but it is a different shade of brown.  Take note, but a great price.",
        "This vest is very lightweight.  Insulation is kind of thin.  Doesn't really keep me warm below 50 degrees F. But it's good for blocking the wind and good as an added layer for motorcycle riding.  Size is ok, but maybe a little small for size XL.  I probably wouldn't order this vest again.  I also ordered the Alpine Swiss Mens Clark vest at the same time.  The Alpine Swiss vest is much warmer and size is more like XL for about the same price.",
        "Vest came in perfect condition. Surprisingly warm for how light weight it is. Have worn it during chilly golf rounds many times so far and it has done me great. Would recommend.",

Lo mejor de todo son las 2 bolsas interiores que trae, bastante grandes.

        "I took away one point because of the extreme shrinkage. These Gold Toe Argyle socks wear well and I like the material very much. After decades of buying inferior socks, I've found the Gold Toe Argyle socks to be the least inferior. Not a resounding recommendation, but realistic. I just bought more in a different color than my last purchase. But they shrink like crazy. I already knew they would shrink. All my Gold Toe socks shrink by massive amounts. These are all the Extra Large size for shoe size 12-16. That's my size 12 shoe in the photo. Here is a photo of my new socks next to a set that I bought 6 weeks ago. 6 Weeks ago!!! I had to go back to my Amazon orders to double check that it was only 6 weeks ago. They shrank like this after the first washing. Cold water wash and rinse with Tide detergent. I had not realized how much they shrank until I just got this new pair.And by the way ... the old socks are the \"Black Argyle Mix\". The new socks are the \"Navy Argyle Mix.\" I'm not seeing much difference except in the pair at the top. I was expecting socks with variants of blue colors. Colors are acceptable, but the question is ... which country has a navy with these colors? Not the American navy!",

        "Nautica is still the highest quality. Beautiful wool blend look and feel. Size is old school standard. Modern sizing seems to have no standard. I\u2019m 5ft 10 in and 320 pounds. I ordered a 4X because I wanted to be able to wear it over a heavy sweatshirt in extreme weather but 3X would have fit fine. The sleeves are too long as I expected they would be but the coat is worth the added cost of having the sleeves altered. Very nice quilted lining too. Very warm and comfortable. You won\u2019t find a better quality coat anywhere and the sale prices make it more than affordable.",
        "I needed a dressy type coat and took a chance on this.  Not my typical style and I did not think I would like it all.  I was wrong.  It appears and feels to be high quality, it's comfortable, it's warm, it fits great, and it looks great!  I'm impressed with it.  5 stars!  I actually bought a second one to give as a gift.",
        "Happy with purchase, especially for the price. Coat is sturdy, appears to be well constructed and stylish. Saw this coat listed on a 'top 10 Peacoats' list and decided to try it for my son. He is 6'2\" and it hits him at the top of his thigh, so a good length. He is happy with it. However, the coats runs large. According to the size chart, we needed a large, ordered it and it was too big. Returned it, got a medium and its great.",
        "These pea-coats are nice looking. They do keep you warm but not as other but have a nice fit",
        "Purchased for my son. He was delighted. Better quality than he expepected and at a very good price during holiday sales.",
        "Beautiful jacket for what is for--nothing like my original bought 30 years ago- however very close and recommended-------is it possible to fix the arms length 2 inches shorter??????",
        "So this jacket is a modern slimmer cut interpretation of the classic pea coat. Where a traditional pea coat is large and boxy in order to fit over several layers, this coat fits more like a sportcoat. I'm 6'1\", 196 lbs. I wear a 44R suit coat with 34W pants. I wanted a slimmer fitting pea coat for the less chilly days when a t-shirt or button down was being worn. This coat sizing is perfect for that. Shoulder seams fall perfectly and it is just roomy enough through the waist. If I wanted to wear a sweater or layer thicker clothing, this would be too tight and I would wear a traditional cut pea coat. Length is on par with the length you would find on a suit or sport jacket. The material is a softer, lighter weight, tighter woven fabric. Again warm enough for cool days, probably want something heavier if your in a colder climate or just don't tolerate cold very well. The underside of the collar has a bit of the same material used to line the jacket sewn in as a contrast. Not sure whether I like it or not, but this is a design choice and is only seen if you pop the collar to seal up your neck. Now as others have mentioned the quality control is a little off. The right side lower buttons are sewn through to the inside causing and odd constriction near the pocket. It is not sewn through the pocket and is easily remedied by removing the thread and restitching the buttons. For $80 or less, I feel this is a good coat that can have the minor QC issues easily remedied. For any higher cost or for a true original sizing or warmth level, keep looking. I already own a traditional cut wool pea coat, so this fit my needs at a reasonable price point. I would recommend this coat to others with the same needs as I.",
        "This jacket look even better in real life than in the stock picture.  It's definitely a jacket dress to impress.  The color is rich and deep, the texture look really smooth and polish and the material look really upscale.  I carefully inspected the stitching, buttons and pockets lining and every little detail is perfect.  My skin has always been sensitive to wool and it was my neck area itches a little the first day or two but now I get used to it.It's a heavy jacket so it's really warm and I like that I can cover my neck area unlike other men's over coat that I have.  It's a heavy jacket so it keeps me warm even when temperature was 31 degrees the other day and windy.  But it's not overly heavy like my other full length overcoats.  And because it is not a full length coat it makes it much easier to get in and out of cars.This high quality coat definitely does the Nautica name justice and I am really glad I paid a little more for this coat than other brand that I was considering.  It's definitely worth the money and I trust that it will serve me well for many years to come.",
        "Excelente calidad de materiales, muy buena calidez y vale por lo que se paga.",
        "Very happy with this purchase. The coat has a quality feel and a sharp look.It's a bit thin for the dead of winter on its own, but with some layers underneath it will keep you warm and cozy all season long.",
        "Altezza 1,70. Peso 97kg taglia XL perfetta, accorciate le maniche di pochissimo, veste bene, anche con maglione pesante sotto, utilizzato con temperature di 2/3 gradi e con pioviggine. Aspetto decisamente marinaresco e vintage. Visto il prezzo mi ritengo molto soddisfatto. Non so quanto durer\u00e0, ma sar\u00e0 problema del prossimo inverno. Non metto 5 stelle perch\u00e9 manca un piccolo dettaglio che era presente sul Pea Coat che avevo tanti anni fa: sotto il bavero una aletta abbottonata sia  dx che a sx che permetteva di chiudere il bavero davanti",
        "Se trata de un chaquet\u00f3n marinero de muy buena calidad y sienta muy bien. Talla correctamente.",
        "Nice coat! Especially for the price. Fits great, doesn\u2019t feel cheap, and is surprisingly warm. Would definitely consider buying another in the future....I\u2019m 6\u20191\u201d 200lbs and I bought a medium."

        "I recently got my hands on the Merrell Unisex-Adult's Wool Everyday Hiking Socks in the 3 Pair Pack with Cushion Arch, and they've quickly become an essential part of my outdoor gear. These socks provide exceptional comfort with their well-designed cushioning, particularly in the arch area, making long hikes and outdoor activities far more enjoyable. Even in cooler weather, the wool blend in these socks keeps my feet warm without causing overheating, striking a perfect balance between insulation and breathability. Moreover, their durability is impressive; they've proven to be exceptionally resilient even with regular use and washing, showing no signs of wear or thinning. Additionally, these socks stay in place during hikes, ensuring that they don't slide down or bunch up, which is essential for preventing blisters and discomfort. Their unisex design is also convenient, making them suitable for both men and women. While they may be on the pricier side compared to other hiking socks, the quality and performance they deliver make them a worthwhile investment for outdoor enthusiasts. If you enjoy spending time outdoors, I highly recommend giving these Merrell hiking socks a try\u2014they might just become your go-to choice for your outdoor adventures.",
        "Socks are tricky for me, I have sensory issues due to my ADHD/Autism so I need soft, breathable socks but I also need them to keep my feet warm and provide some cushioning between my feet and work boots. It\u2019s a hard line to straddle. Wool is best for warmth and moisture-wicking but often wool or wool blends are extremely scratchy and abrasive to my sensitivities. Cotton just falls apart after short periods due to how active my job is.This are some of the best socks I\u2019ve found, full stop. They\u2019re affordable, plush, and very durable in my situation. They give enough cushion on my pressure points from my boots (heels and upper ridge) so there\u2019s no blistering or rubbing either with a new pair of boots or just from long days in shoes, they keep my feet warm when I\u2019m stuck in coolers at work for 3+ hours at a time, and they\u2019re not restricting or too snug around my ankles or toes. I can even wear them to sleep on cold nights without yanking them off in my sleep. Durability is solid, for me at least. They\u2019ve gotten wet, muddy, absconded with via cats, and other manners of abuse that necessitate heavy cleaning and held up well. No pilling or thinning of the fabric to my eyes as of yet.I wear a US Women\u2019s 9 shoe and bought the S/M size and they fit me perfectly.",
        "They're very soft and pretty thick - great for colder weather (but I'd wear them year-round).",
        "Good fit..warm and comfy",
        "All wool.  Comfortable.  Fit well (I wear a wome's size 8-1/2 shoe).  They're still new, so I can say how they hold up.",
        "Love these socks been buying these for years from Merrel. These socks have high cushion and feel amazing. Great quality and long lasting wash after wash. These socks won\u2019t disappoint!",
        "Great fit, great comfort. So far, they wash and wear well. I would highly recommend!",
        "This is the 2nd time I have ordered these socks. They are incredibly warm, well made and fit my small foot!",
        "Great fit and comfort",
        "Very good product, fit great & good sizing for me, size 11.  They also look as they will last, which is good as they\u2019re not cheap!",
        "These are very warm and they wash well.",

        "Muy comodos y en mi experiencia se me meti\u00f3 un poco de agua al calzado sent\u00eda el agua en el calcet\u00edn pero mi pie estaba seco y calientito"

        "I like this hoodie so far. It\u2019s comfortable and will keep you warm, seeing as it\u2019s decently thick. It\u2019s held up well after cleaning it a few times too, the fabric blend seems durable.It\u2019s easy to slide right on and get all cozy in. It\u2019s also great as it has a middle pocket for your phone or whatever else you want to bring around with you. I will say the one part of this hoodie that stands out as a con for is that the neck hole is a bit small and so putting it over your head is a pain but no big deal after a couple seconds of that ordeal. Then it\u2019s spacious and nice for hours and hours.Don\u2019t expect it to be extra long in length, as the shape of the hoodie is standard torso fit; neck to tummy. If anything, the length is slightly short relative to sizing - seeing as size L just meets the top of my thigh (for reference I\u2019m 5 ft 4 and kinda fat). If you are taller or heavier and want something that reaches thigh, I recommend a size above L.The hoodie is very much a men\u2019s build. It\u2019s not feminine one bit and will not flatter a waistline or chest. It is very accommodating for bulkier builds, seeing as it has a lot of shoulder room, chest room, and sleeve length. Especially good for someone with a broader torso. If you\u2019re bulked you will probably get a good money\u2019s worth on this.",
        "This sweatshirt isn't super heavy duty, but has a nice soft, warm inside. If you tend to get cold easily, I would recommend wearing this with a jacket, but for people who are used to living where the air hurts your face, this is perfect for a 30\u00b0(F) day (as long as it's not too windy...if you know...you know).",
        "Bought the Heather gray in Nov and it was great. Heavy weight, comfortable and roomy. Came back and bought it again in Navy but very different. Heavy weight but shrunk a lot. The gray one did not",
        "My husband loves these. They are great material and a great fit. The only suggestion is more room around the neck. He cut his just a little to not feel so constricted.",
        "Very warm and comfortable. Nice weight and well made.",
        "The head hole it\u2019s so Damm small, I\u2019m a girl I got a size medium (usually size xs or s) for an oversized fit but it was so tight around the neck it just feels uncomfortable. Also the fabric it\u2019s thick but not in a a comfy way,  not soft at all kinda stiff  even after washing.Overall thoughts; could be loser around the neck but it\u2019ll keep you warm bc of thick fabric",

        "fantastic fit, length, durability and great comfort.  price is great for regular use or for work so your not spending a lot on shorts that might get ruined.  love em!!!!!",
        "I bought a pair of these a while ago, and they quickly became my favorite shorts.  For some reason, it has since become quite rare to find shorts with the external sliding cell phone pocket.  The pocket on these work great for me.  The phone stays put and is super convenient to access.  The material is also quite comfortable and the stretchy waistband makes for a variable and perfect fit.  So when I saw them up here for a very reasonable price, I got several more.",
        "I love these shorts. They are extremely comfortable. Lightweight enough to dry quickly but thick enough to be durable. Great in my opinion for a hike or the gym. Lots of pockets, including an extra on the right side that fits a standard iPhone perfectly for quick in and out. Of course you can put it under Velcro secure flap for greater security. These fit a slim figure very well - not too baggy",
        "Awesome shorts! These shorts are comfy and lightweight. They are great for the hot summer days.  I like the cargo pockets. Deep enough for storing my phone and keys. They fit true to size and have enough stretch to move in easily all day. Easy to wash. No fading or shrinking.  Great quality shorts. I defiantly will buy again. 100% recommend!!",

        "I bought these shorts in advance of a trip to tbe sunny south and they are exactly what I hoped they would be. The fit was perfect (size 34), they appear durable, yet lightweight. Perfect for days of 30C/90F. As the title suggests, I love the \u201chidden\u201d smartphone pocket on the right leg. You can just slide your phone right in there and it\u2019s out of sight. Though if your protective cover/case is thick, it may not slide in there as easily as mine.",

        "these shirts fit really nice, they are a crisp white, and they wash up real nice.",
        "Perfectly fine for those in shape.. for us older folks whose chest has dropped to their waist, it's a pretty tight fit.  I probably should've gotten a \"tall\" as there wasn't much to tuck into my trousers.  Looks great, comfortable material.",
        "I\u2019ve been looking for a deal like this for a while. I wanted some company branded shirts, but their supplier only offered standard fit shirts (that are oddly large around the torso).These are available in several colors. The fit is almost perfect (for me anyway), they\u2019re wrinkle free, and the price is right. I initially did a \u201ctry before you buy\u201d with three different colors. I liked them so much I paid for those and ordered a fourth.",
        "This is a great shirt, it fit me perfectly except the 17\u201d neck size was too tight when buttoned. I ordered two replacement shirts 17.5 neck 34/35 sleeve. They fit well, although increasing the neck size also increases the shirt body size so the shirt isn\u2019t as fitted to my body as my first order. I\u2019m 5\u201911\u201d, 190lbs.",

Neck fits well, sleeves ar long enough. As you can see there is a great choice of colours and sizes. These are a fitted shirt, so check your sizing. They do sell them in regular or Classic fit.",

I recommend buying 1 size smaller or buy in 2 different sizes, since returns are free to see what works for you best!I purchased both top and bottom from 2 different companies:TOP- this one \"Terramar\"",
        "I wear for the cold weather, and it feels comfortable and warm",

        "These are the most comfortable long underwear/base layer I've found and I've tried several. I'm female and 5'10\" so have trouble finding the appropriate fit with the women's base layers I've tried. The men's small fits well. Soft and breathable yet supportive material that doesn't stretch out with wear and extremely comfortable, even for lounging or sleeping in. Haven't tried them in temps below the 10s, but they're warm.",
        "I bought this as a lightening deal so the cost was good.  My goal was to use it for some extra warmth on cool camping trips.  I was very happy when I wore them alone in a 40 degree bag and the temp dropped to 38.  I was cool but I would have froze if not for these.  Even when I opened the sleeping bag, my legs were still warm.  I ended up putting my pants over them and spent the entire day wearing them.  I'll buy a 2nd pair for myself and some for my sons who camp with me and always seem to forget warm clothes.  I am 5'7\" and the medium was a perfect fit.",
        "i purchased this as a gift for my hubby for his birthday.  He enjoys hiking and long walks during the cooler weather and these help keep his lower body nice and toasty.  Especially this year we had a brutal winter in the Northeast and the chilly wind was howling some days.  He wore the thermolators underneath his regular sports/hiking pants and he said he did not feel the chill.  Best thing about them is they are not too tight and not loose they fit just rights. He also found them to be breathable and didn't make his body sweat.  If your looking for a supportive pair of underlayer pants these are good...  I hope this is helpful for somebody",
        "Utterly useless for winter, as it cools you instead of keeping you warm.  Walk out in -8c under my jeans, and could feel the cold right through the fabric.  Had to walk back in the house in 2 minutes before catching a cold.  Maybe meant for sports use, to keep you cool during intense activities."

        "Good quality product, it seems a half size bigger but it's fine and comfortable.",
        "I purchased these after having bought a Champion x Todd Snyder collab sweatshirt ($100 for one) that i promptly ruined with a splash of bleach. For that price I got three of these and don\u2019t worry so much about stains or splashes. These are actually a bit lighter, but also softer and warmer than the more expensive one and it has the stitched neck V that i like. The only issue i have with them is the inconsistency in some of the details. I ordered both large and extra large to see what fit me best. I\u2019m 6\u2019 tall and 190lbs, slim athletic build. The XL seemed a bit large, and I don\u2019t like baggy sweatshirts, but the L fit a bit snug and was tight across the chest. Previous reviews state these don\u2019t shrink, but i figured they\u2019d tighten up a little after washing - I wasn\u2019t wrong. The Large became unwearable, and the XL is just right. I was amazed by the difference in size between the two though, see pics. It seems like a difference of two sizes instead of one. Anyway, they don\u2019t really \u201cshrink\u201d but the fibers do tighten up after the first wash cycle, so just be aware of that. My biggest gripe is with the labels. The listing shows a label on the bottom front of the garment. These were present on the Large size, but all of the XL\u2019s didn\u2019t have it. Also the ones with the label had a greyed out Champion \u201cC\u201d on the sleeve, but the XL\u2019s had the typical colored version. See pics. I was really hoping for the label, as i like that detail, but be aware you might not receive that. Also - these will leave heavy lint on your t shirts worn underneath until you\u2019ve washed them a few times. It\u2019s not an issue now, but was quite alarming when trying them on. Despite these minor things, they are really comfortable and warm shirts that look good. Definitely not rag-tag gym sweats.",
        "I bought him this sweatshirt for Christmas and he loves it. Says it\u2019s comfortable to wear and the blue is a nice color. I\u2019ve washed it many times and it has really done up nicely.",
        "Good product for price ,fits good to size no complaints.",
        "This crewneck is warm. I have a few old school Champion mostly cotton hoodies, yet this crewneck has a well used polyester to create a fuzzy insulation of heat.",
        "Warmth and comfort and the item fulfilled both.",
        "Fue para mi pap\u00e1, pedimos talla G y le qued\u00f3 como oversized, no demasiado, lo justo. Se ve incre\u00edble puesta. Nos gust\u00f3 mucho. Es muy calientita y la verdad es de las cosas que se ven a\u00fan m\u00e1s bonitas en persona que en la foto!! La recomendamos!!",

        "Hudson is my go-to pant brand. I've never been disappointed with any of their stuff. Probably due to the fact that they've always been a perfect fit for my 6ft 175lb frame. They almost contour perfectly, never feeling tight nor uncomfortable. If I had to nitpick with this pair, I'd say the pant size pocket patch on the rear is a bit big for my rear end. Either that, or my rear end is too small for the pocket patch, but everything else is spot on as far as fit and comfort. Just amazed I can still fit into a skinny pair with my 34 inch waist. Fortunately, if I gain a few pounds, these are the stretchy kind of material, so they will expand a few inches without having to alter them. I went with the Noctural color which I think is a stand out color vs all the other typical Jean colors. As of right now, this Nocturnal color is on sale for $60 which I think is a good deal for a pair of Hudson pants, so if they're still at that price, I would grab them as they're the kind of pant you'll have 10 years from now and they'll barely look worn in. At least that's my experience with the Hudson brand.",
        "They didn't stretch at all. The fit was great and color was nice, but they were stuck on my calves and I couldn't pull up as high as I wanted, which made me feel kinda uncomfortable",
        "I'm reviewing the Skinny regular \"reveal\" type. First off -- quality is about average and comparable to generic brand-name jeans at department stores -- nothing exceptional there. The price in my opinion is too high, but I believe these are more of a designer-name brand jean. In that case, this price may be par-for-course.Outside of this let's talk about the fit. As mentioned, these are the skinny \"regular\" jeans. The kneecap down is a very tight fit -- even for skinny-legged people. The thighs/butt area is looser and would fit tight on average body types. To reiterate -- on a skinny body, the kneecap down is *very* tight fitting and relaxes through the thighs and butt. The calves have no give and the foot opening is about as small as you can get. These look good if you don't want excess calve/ankle material floating around and want jeans to hug (and I mean *really* hug) your calve.To talk more on quality -- these are fairly thin and will not take a lot of abuse. Therefore these are meant really for fashion and going out rather than work jeans. The color reveal is very nice -- no rips anywhere so it's a gradient color without any emblems/markings etc.When wearing them they are very soft and comfortable but the legs (mentioned above) below the knee cap is tight, tight, tight. Oh, and the rise -- it's mid length and very comfortable (i.e. doesn't squeeze in certain areas).Overall a comfortable/soft pair of jeans that is a bit overpriced. The fit is skinny through the calves and relaxed in the thighs and seat. If you have an average body type -- you might want to size up. If you have large calves then definitely size up.",
        "When I go out for a nice dinner in NYC, I love to get dressed up with some swag that allows me to stand out from the crowd. When I saw these jeans pop up in my feed, I decided to give them a try.The jean itself feels pretty soft and what you would expect from a pair of jeans. They are skinny fit, which I do not prefer but overall, they do fit me pretty well. I am between a size 36-38 and these fit me pretty well.",
        "",
        "My husband has an athletic build and is 6'0/190lbs. We got a size 33 in Ocean Way and they look great on him. You can tell it's not a super skinny fit where it's restricting all parts of his legs. There's just the right amount of stretch where he can move without any restrictions. The denim itself is soft and not rigid.In regards to the smell, I noticed after we opened the bag we got a nice whiff of laundry detergent. It kind of reminds me of Tide w/ Febreeze. It's not a bad thing per se but just caught me off guard."

        "I love Thorlos socks. They are the only socks I\u2019ve found that the seams don\u2019t irritate my feet. Follow the washing directions and turn them inside out. This keeps the weaving on the seams soft. However be mindful of the size. I wear a size 10 in women\u2019s shoes. I bought the recommended size in medium. They were a bit too small in length. After washing and wearing them I felt it wouldn\u2019t be right to return them. They are expensive socks and the sizing was why I gave them 4 stars and not five.  Update: I repurchased these socks in a large. The fit is great and feel wonderful on my feet. They are padded in all the right places, but it\u2019s not so thick that your feet feel crammed into your shoe. I\u2019ve bought 6 more pairs since I\u2019ve tried the large. The right size gives them 5 stars.",
        "I have bought this brand for years. They are my favorite athletic socks. Lots of cushioning for the balls and heel of your foot, but breathable in the places that need less. The short length stays on your foot during high-impact sports. These socks are expensive, but I\u2019ve had pairs last ten years.",
        "These socks fit really well and feel so good to walk in.",

        "These socks are padded in all the right places. I have painful feet and they really help",
        "These are great.  A little expensive, but so is lost training due to blisters...  These fit your feet tight and offer some cushioning to provide blister free comfortable running.  Longevity?  I bought a pair about a year ago and they still seem fine in that they have no worn spots or holes in them.  They did loosen up around the ankles a bit which let them sometimes slip into the shoe, so I retired them.  I bought three pairs this round and hope they will last a while.  They're just socks, however...  I do expect to replace them at some point!  For size, I made a mistake here.  The first pair I bought was off the self where I could look at the size chart on the package.  I didn't pay attention to the \"sock\" size as in S M or L, I just looked at the shoes size.  I wear a size 10 shoe.  It turns out, the in the Thorlo world, size 10 shoe means a size M in socks...  I bought a pack of L size socks meant for shoe size 11 and up.  They bunched up under my toes...  No good.  Bought the size M socks, and all was well.  If you run, try these.",

        "So, picture this: a beach full of perfectly sculpted bodies strutting their stuff in stylish swim trunks, and here I am, just an average Joe trying to soak up the sun. But fear not!

        "Fit and quality seem just right.  I have a 32\" waist and skinny thighs and size medium was a good fit...some real compression but not cutting off the blood.  Material has a good feel to it and is very comfortable during a workout. It's been through the wash once and still looks/feels new.",
        "The first pair i got was Medium.. which usually fit.. these were a little small, but i will wear them.. the second pair i got large and they fit better.  Surprised they had a paper tag in themWas shocked they were sent in a very flimsy see through plastic.  I thought underwear would be in paper.. You could clearly see them.. and a little poke of the finger and anyone could have had their hands on them.. yuk..  now that i have had them a while.. and worn them some more.. i am liking them better.. even the medium pair seems to be fitting better... I like the extra elastine or spandex in them.. i like 15% or more in them",
        "Great bang for your buck. Good quality. Comfortable to wear.",
        "Bought these to help with thigh chaffing while running. They solved the problem and are comfy. No complaints.",
        "It's a decent compression trunk. Feels like it provides a moderate amount of compression. Expect it to be a bit tight. Material is thick enough. It has a pocket, but it seems a bit small for a cup. I haven't worn it with a cup.",
        "Love the fit! I just wish the had a fly so i didnt have to pull them down in order to pee.",
        "1st, price is good and nice comfortable fit.  But could use much more compression. If needing strong compression, look elsewhere.  But worth the price and very comfortable as it is snug to right above my knees at 5'11\", 32\" inseam.",
        "La diferencia en el precio entre la talla M y la talla G era abismal, no s\u00e9 porqu\u00e9, as\u00ed que me arriesgu\u00e9 y ped\u00ed la G sabiendo que soy M con tal de ahorrarme muchos pesos. Afortunadamente la talla est\u00e1 reducida, y me qued\u00f3 como si fuera mi talla. Esperemos que no se afloje con el tiempo, cosa que s\u00ed sucede con su marca hermana \"Champion\".",
        "I came across these underwear while searching for a pair that would prevent thigh chafe in summer since I sweat a great deal as a landscaper. These drawers are the shit!! They did exactly what I hoped they would, preventing chafe while being comfortable and breathable. One thing I have to mention is that the size chart maybe slightly off, I am a size 33 or 34 waist but I ordered a large by mistake which actually turned out to be the perfect fit, if I had ordered the medium as I had intended they would have been too small",
        "good quality",
        "This is not comfortable at all to wear. If you see the design around crotch area in product photo, you can see 3 seams going down. Its an extremely uncomfortable chafing feel on the inner side due to these seams especially where they converge. Also the sag is too much for any active usage. Its very uncomfortable to wear. But for the discomfort around crotch area, it is ok - but then that discomfort is too bad. I am returning it.",

        "Pros:+ Generous Fit in Thighs and Buttocks: Ideal for individuals with larger thighs and buttocks, ensuring comfort and flexibility.+ Tapered Leg Design: Offers a stylish look without being overly skinny, suitable for various body types.+ Lightweight Material: The fabric is lighter than standard jeans, providing a cooler feel.+ Stretchy and Flexible: Excellent for bending and squatting, making it ideal for retail work or active lifestyles.+ Size Variety: Available in many waist and leg sizes, accommodating weight fluctuations.+ Durability: Resistant to shrinking and fading in the wash.+ Value for Money: Reasonably priced at $24, offering a balance between quality and affordability.+ Decent Pocket Design: Including a coin section to secure loose change.Cons:- Not Super Breathable: The material, while lighter than jeans, is not the most breathable.- Pilling in Crotch Area: Some early signs of wear, though not immediate thinning.- Slight Leg Tapering Issue: Could benefit from slightly more tapering for a better fit.- Small Pockets: The pocket design, especially with the sub-pocket, can be impractical for storing larger items like phones or wallets.- Mid-Rise vs. Low-Rise Confusion: Some confusion in the rise of the pants, with a preference for a clearer description.- Sizing Issues: Some users noted a need to size up, particularly for those with a thicker build.- Limited Longevity for Intensive Use: May not be suitable for heavy-duty use, as evidenced by the early split in the crotch seam for some users.Upon trying the Amazon Essentials Men's Athletic-Fit 5-Pocket Stretch Twill Pant, I was pleasantly surprised by the comfortable fit and flexibility. As someone who values both style and comfort, these pants struck a nice balance. The tapered leg offered a modern look without restricting movement, which I found particularly useful during my active days.The lightweight nature of the fabric was a welcome feature, making the pants suitable for warmer days. Additionally, the stretchiness of the material allowed for easy movement, which is a must for anyone with an active job or lifestyle.However, I did encounter some minor issues. The material, while lighter than denim, could benefit from increased breathability. Additionally, I noticed some pilling in the crotch area after a few weeks of wear, raising some concerns about long-term durability.The pocket design, particularly the small size and the sub-pocket, was a bit of a letdown. It made carrying larger items like a wallet or phone somewhat inconvenient.In terms of sizing, I recommend paying close attention to the sizing chart and considering a size up, especially for individuals with a solid or curvy build. It's crucial to get the right fit for comfort and style.In conclusion, while not without its flaws, the Amazon Essentials Men's Athletic-Fit 5-Pocket Stretch Twill Pant offers a solid option for thoseseeking a balance between style, comfort, and affordability. The range of sizes and the flexibility of the fabric make these pants a viable option for a wide demographic, particularly for those who struggle with finding pants that accommodate larger thighs and buttocks. The tapered leg is a stylish touch, though a bit more tapering could enhance the fit for some.The lightweight material is a standout feature, providing a cooler alternative to traditional jeans, which is a significant advantage in warmer climates or for those prone to overheating. The stretchiness of the fabric also ensures ease of movement, making these pants suitable for various activities, from casual outings to more physically demanding tasks.One area of improvement would be the breathability of the fabric. Although lighter than standard jeans, increased airflow would enhance comfort, especially during prolonged wear. The early signs of pilling in the crotch area are a minor concern, suggesting that while these pants are durable, they may not withstand extremely rigorous use over an extended period.The design of the pockets, particularly their size and the inclusion of a sub-pocket, could be reevaluated. Larger and more practical pockets would enhance the functionality of these pants, especially in today's world where carrying multiple items like phones, wallets, and keys is the norm.Sizing is crucial with these pants. It's advisable to carefully review the size chart and consider sizing up for a more comfortable fit, especially for those with a fuller build. The confusion between mid-rise and low-rise in the product description should be clarified to help buyers make a more informed decision.Despite some drawbacks, the Amazon Essentials Men's Athletic-Fit 5-Pocket Stretch Twill Pant stands out as a valuable addition to the wardrobe for its affordability, style, and comfort. They are a commendable choice for anyone seeking a reliable pair of pants that won't break the bank. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a versatile, comfortable pair of pants that cater to a variety of sizes and body types.",
        "I wanted a pair of pants that would be good for general living and also would work for my physical activities. These pants fit the bill and also fit my body. The athletic fit and 35\" waist combination was the advantage that other brands did not offer. I have been surprised at how much stretch and comfort that the 1% Elastane adds. Good for workouts, strenuous mountain biking, or a relaxing day of watching football on TV.",

I've read reviews about other colors & how cheap the material is but as far as this shirt goes I have to disagree. This is hands down a great shirt for 5 bucks, I say that after buying plenty of 10/15/20 dollar shirts at department stores that feel & wash like a dollar shirt. I hope the factory that makes the Deep Forest feel like a high quality shirt continues to do so and for other colors as well. Bought a XL after originally deciding on a L size.",

It was a beefy-t know as Hi-Cru.  The fit was consistent and the fabric was beefy.  This latest version runs a little snugger than before and not as beefy, which actually is a good thing now with this warm weather.  It's a good product.",

My new purchases have been re-purposed as dusters already (and they're not much use for that either with the synthetic content). Not good at all.",

        "The wears are a bit tight. Other than that after a few wears and washes the material feels great. Soft and stretchy! I will order more at some point but move up one size. I really enjoy the patterns and how well they\u2019re made.",
        "Great quality boxer briefs for an amazing price!Soft cotton and the elastic is sturdy, but not stiff.  Great style and fit.I had low expectations given the Amazon Essentials brand and I was wrong. As good as my Jockey brand at a fraction of the price.Large worked for me. 5\u2019 11\u201d - 187 lbs.",
        "I wasn\u2019t sure if the quality was going to be there until I got it and I felt the material and then I put it on and so far I\u2019m very happy with it. 5 pairs for this  price is really good. I definitely recommend it.",
        "I was advised to order a medium based on my past orders of 32 inch waist jeans. They fit but are extremely snug. I may order again, one size up. The briefs are high quality and comfy, though.",
        "I think this brand has been around few years.  It\u2019s great.  Comfort level as good as established brands, can\u2019t tell the difference, and it\u2019s as cheap or cheaper than most established brands.  Why not build out a portfolio of brand names and logos, rather than calling it all Amazon Essentials if the quality is almost as exact, such as perhaps a running sneaker, obviously not boxers or t-shirts, hence probably deserves a more catchy image and brand name.",
        "Bought these for my fiance. He states that these are pretty comfortable. The no tag is nice. The patterns are simple but good. Decent pack of underwear.",
        "The Amazon Essentials Men's 5-Pack Tag-Free Boxer Briefs have become a staple in my daily wardrobe, providing a comfortable and practical solution for everyday wear.The tag-free design adds a layer of comfort, eliminating any irritation that can be associated with traditional tags.

        "Son c\u00f3modos.",
        "Gefallen hat mir die h\u00fcbsche , funktionelle Verpackung  und die gute Qualit\u00e4t der Ware.",
        "Con i boxer aderenti si corre sempre il rischio che siano troppo... aderenti! ;)Questi invece vestono molto comodi con il giusto grado di elasticit\u00e0... ma fino ad un certo punto della giornata: dopo qualche ora il tessuto si rilassa e diventa molto meno aderente. Per me \u00e8 un aspetto positivo, ma per chi preferisce un effetto pi\u00f9 contenitivo forse non sono il massimo. Personalmente soddisfatto, ne comprer\u00f2 altri!",
        "Les cale\u00e7ons en taille M sont parfaits, ajustement impeccable. Le 100% coton offre une sensation douce et agr\u00e9able. La longueur est juste comme il faut. Dans l'ensemble, une excellente qualit\u00e9. J'en suis si satisfait que je pr\u00e9vois d'en racheter."

        "Comfortable and true to size",
        "So far so good with these socks.  My current plan is to finally toss all my old ones and buy more of these...enough to go at least on a six week trip without having to do laundry.  I just want to wash them a few more times before they don't start falling apart (I do update my reviews upon disappointment...or delight).Quite seriously, I've had some horrible socks since my previous go-to brand went out of production.  One set just completely starting coming apart at the bottoms, creating tons of lint and leaving me with holes within weeks.  Another serious try were generics, but they are thicker, but leave their own kind of odd fuzz and say something stupid and un-pronounceable on them (probably too thick for comfort in summer, especially).Now I'm not saying these are amazing quality - nothing is these days - but I think they're built right.  Top is thin, but bottom is thicker - probably right for comfort in the summer without them falling apart.  So far, they're not showing signs of leaving too much material behind.  I suppose I can deal with them saying \"Hanes\" - it's only on the bottom.And the size - I think that is a good thing.  These are XL, specifically meant for size 12 and up.  I'm thinking not having to stretch them so much is going to keep them lasting longer while continuing to look decent, not to mention a tad more comfortable.If for any reason my plan changes and these don't become my go to, I will remember to update this."

        "These are very thin and don\u2019t provide much warmth. They are comfortable and loose fitting everywhere but the calf. I do have a large muscular calf so that may be the issue. Would recommend and purchase again.",
        "These joggers fit great! I'm 5'6\" 155 lbs with a 34\" waist so I bought Medium (Navy Blue). When I buy medium pajama bottoms the legs are always about 8 inches too long and I have to ask my wife to cut off the excess and hem them. That is not the case with these joggers, the band around the ankles keeps the length in check. The waistband is very comfortable. These pants are not baggy like pajama bottoms usually are either. Overall, these joggers seem to be of good quality, they look good, and feel good too.These joggers were thinner than expected but seem plenty warm for indoors and great for PJs. I will be buying more!",
        "Liked the fit.  It's light weight as well.  Overall pretty good product.",
        "These are not particularly thick so don\u2019t expect them to be warm and coz sweatpants. But they are very comfortable and well made. They look nice when I step out in public wearing them. I don\u2019t look like a hobo and that\u2019s always a plus for me.",
        "These sweat pants fit me quite well. I'm 5'7\" 180 lbs and most pants I buy tend to have legs that are too long. That's why I searched for sweat pants that have cuffs. I wanted a lightweight material (jersey) without a fleece lining because I sleep in these in the warmer months in Michigan. The material is perfect, and the leg cuffs, which are just the right amount of tightness, keep the pants from wearing too uncomfortably long.  The waist is also just right (I chose a 'large' size). The only quibble I have is that the waist drawstring is a loop  that is just too long. It was far too easy to catch a toe in it when putting the pants on. So I simply cut the loop and trimmed off some excess length from both ends and I tie them together in a bow. Perhaps that's what we're supposed to do anyway, but I didn't see anything in the labels or online that stated that. Anyway, I'm very happy with it. You just have to do some minor surgery.",
        "Comfort: These joggers live up to their \"Everyday Cotton\" name. The fabric is super soft and breathable, perfect for lounging around or running errands. The XL size provides plenty of room without feeling baggy, and the relaxed fit makes them ideal for all-day wear.Style: While not the trendiest joggers on the block, these Champion classics offer a casual, athletic look that goes well with t-shirts, hoodies, or even dressier tops for a laid-back weekend vibe. The subtle Champion logo adds a touch of brand recognition without being over the top.Functionality: The drawstring waistband ensures a secure fit, and the pockets are deep enough to hold your essentials. Plus, the cotton material washes well and maintains its shape.Downsides: Some users mention that the fabric can wrinkle a bit, especially after sitting for long periods. Also, the lack of tapered legs might not appeal to everyone who prefers a slimmer fit.Overall: These Champion joggers are a solid choice for those seeking comfortable, everyday wear. They offer great value for the price and deliver on their promise of everyday comfort and casual style. Just remember, they might not be the trendiest option, and the relaxed fit might not be for everyone.Bonus tip: Pair them with your favorite sneakers for a laid-back look, or elevate the style with a bomber jacket and some Chelsea boots for a casual chic vibe.",
        "You know you\u2019ve hit the mark as a parent when your teenage son opens the package with these grey joggers inside and says, \u201cLet\u2019s Gooooo\u201d.

He reports they are comfortable and I know it must be true because he won\u2019t wear anything uncomfortable or \u201cuncool\u201d\u2026I know that\u2019s not something kids say but you get what I\u2019m saying here.

        "I first must say, they appear to be a well made pair of pants and the waist expander works. But that being said the material is much lighter than expected--not the medium weight that I had hoped for. The other issue was a friend on viewing them on me said the front looked a bit baggy, though the back fit well on my body and looked great. We will see what washing does to the front. Overall for the 30ish dollar price it was a fair deal for dress pants, they are just fine for that. I have my reservations how they would hold up to a more active wear and life style.",

        "Great men's briefs. Light soft stretch fabric keeps everything where it's supposed to be. The light weight design reduces sweat and doesn't lose its stretch",
        "These are a switch for me as I've typically only worn all cotton material ones before.  I walk a lot in a polyester uniform while at work and my pants are constantly shifting around while walking and climbing stairs, so this length helps keep the chafing down.The material took a couple of wearings to get used to, but now that I am used to it, they are comfortable and stay in place for my 8-10 hour shifts.  They are much thinner that the all cotton ones.  I still prefer more of an all cotton blend, but these are very appropriate for work.",

        "I have ordered these countless times. I love these boxer briefs.  They are especially good for work where I have to walk and bend a lot. The long leg is a must for me. They don\u2019t ride up at all. They keep my thighs from rubbing together. The fly is also a must. I don\u2019t like the ones with no fly. The material is not cotton. It\u2019s slick and stretchy. Just make sure you are getting the right material you want. They are all different. I prefer these for the gym or going to Work. For pajamas I prefer cotton. I highlyRecommend these for anything active or for under swim trunks.",
        "These are quite comfortable and the breathable fabric is good for the gym.The lightning bolts on the waist band did not make me faster or give me super powers.",
        "Did not like the fit, a little tight in the groin area, my husband reported. I\u2019m not sure if its the size thats off or the type of material causing a snugger perceived fit, but we did not wear one stitch of it for longer than 1 minute and wanted them returned. The brand holds up to its name though. We love Hanes because they do carry wholesome products that are worth buying.",
        "These are really breathable and they're comfortable to wear in hot weather. Initially I found the legs to be a bit tight when I put them on, but they do stretch out a bit. I got these on sale and for what they are, I'm satisfied with the purchase."

I want something nicer than gym shorts for doing stuff in town, but most of my older shorts were heavier material cargo shorts.These are just right for what I wanted.  Thin/light fabric that is a lot cooler in hot weather.  I've bought 3 colors so far and like them all.  Only minor issue is that the sizes aren't exactly the same, despite ordering the same waist size for all - one is more snug on legs than the others.

The length is also now too short for my liking.Original:Comfort and style are there.Fit needs some explanation: They fit me almost perfectly. There\u2019s some room in the waist. I bought size 36. I own other size 34 shorts but they are a bit too snug right now (don\u2019t judge). Other reviewers mentioned these being tight in the thighs.

When standing, they are about a inch above the knee for me. I am 5'10.",

Otherwise, it's all wrong for me. It's way too big in the belly or lower area of the shirt. I was hoping I could wear it untucked, but it's way too long  for that and combined with the very loose fit around the belly it winds up looking like a tent. It would be great for tucking in though, with plenty of length.I wasn't expecting it to be quite as thin as it is.

        "I have ordered  two times and a Large each tine, the last order is way too small, almost like they were miss marked. I do not have any of the packing, so I guess I cannot return",
        "I was looking for a sock that fit my size 13 feet well (\u201clike a glove\u201d), had zero cotton to let my feet breathe on long hikes and to help avoid blisters, and that were sturdy and hugged my lower leg (the whole calf) well. Oh, and that didn\u2019t cost 25 bucks a pair! I found these and they fit the bill absolutely perfectly. A cute little cartoon moose paddling a canoe in the mountains ON the socks would be cool, but that little moose comes at quite a price. Really, these are pretty much the best hiking socks I\u2019ve ever owned. Incredibly well made, super sturdy. Very, very flexible. They compress superbly on the foot and leg and pull all the way up over the calf which is super great if it\u2019s at all cold out. I honestly think I\u2019m going to buy more right now before Carhartt realizes they could market these as high-end \u201chiking socks\u201d and charge at least twice as much for them. I\u2019m being totally serious. Put a cartoon RACCOON \ud83e\udd9d  hiking, holding a walking stick with a cute little backpack on and charge THREE times as much. You may think this is a silly joke but I am being absolutely serious here. Gotta run.",
        "These socks literally last forever. They don\u2019t wear thin and they are so comfortable.",
        "Husband has been using for a few months. The quality is nice and he like the moisture wicking but complains that the compression on the legs is pretty tight which causes some itchiness (he has fairly skinny legs).",
        "Great for those who actually work hard. Comfortable, long lasting socks.",
        "The socks are fine quality. Leans more towards a standard sport sock. The main problem is the size. I bought a large and wear size 9. These sock are extremely narrow. I have small calves and ankles. Still these socks are so tight and narrow.",
        "These socks are excellent for comfort, durability, and color. I wear them almost everyday during the winter. They do come up a bit high on my calves but they don't bind my leg in any way.",
        "I don\u2019t write many reviews. This is the 3rd batch of these socks I have bought in 7 years. I am one of those guys who wears the same stuff every day. I have a simple closet and simple life. But that also means I am serious as a heart attack about the QUALITY of the products I buy for daily use. These socks set the standard for me. So glad Carhartt still makes them. They wear like iron. I wear Ariat steel toe cowboy boots and these come all the way up my calf. I am 5\u20199\u201d and 205#. I am farmer strong and have good sized calves. These are just the right \u201ctightness\u201d for me. If you have a Fat Leg then maybe keep looking. But I love love the level of compression these create. Exactly the right amount for 14 hour a day wear. Over time the heels wear out a little but that\u2019s hard as hell to get to that point with these. They also never stink. I don\u2019t have sweaty feet though but I do turn them inside out at night and wear them two days in a row. Sorry if you think that\u2019s gross. But they do NOT smell day 2. If I was going on a thru hike backpacking hike I\u2019d bring two pairs of these. That would be all you need for a couple thousand miles. When I first started wearing these several years ago my ankles would swell if I sat too long at a desk or on an airplane. I swear to God these socks fixed that. I\u2019m a Fan Boy of these and kind find nothing to complain about and I\u2019m sticking with them all the way. Just bought my latest batch Jan 2023 and they are like the old batches. They don\u2019t change much thankfully!",
        "Nice and warm",
        "Carhartt Men's Force Performance Work Socks are the unsung heroes of my daily grind. These socks are like secret agents, stealthily wicking away sweat and keeping my feet drier than a desert. It's like having a personal climate control system for my feet, and they're as comfortable as a hammock for my toes. Three pairs in a pack? It's like a sock revolution! If my feet could high-five, they would. These socks are the real MVPs of my workday \u2013 cozy, durable, and ready to tackle anything, just like a sock superhero trio!",
        "Really comfortable, you could feel the difference on the first wear, one thing that bugs me a bit is how long and how tight the socks are around the calves. Other than that, perfect socks.",
        "Great socks, but a bit tight if you've got large legs. And I ordered the biggest size",

Thick, bold color, stitching good and length. Ordered XL for him and he\u2019s 6 ft 4, 210lbs and they fit well. Definitely ordering more soon!",

Will order these again (assuming of course they don't change like all the other brands did, here's hoping they stay like this batch).",

I have 4 pairs of these pants (2 black, 1 gray, 1 navy) and I wear them daily and rotate them throughout the week. The last one that I had to replace lasted about a year and a half. I would definitely buy them again specially if they get more colors.",

I think by the time I need another the stock will be gone. Why they changed them to that silky shiny style I have no clue.Anyway, the black have stayed nice and dark after 15+ washes and the cognac haven't faded either with just as many washes if not more. Quality zipper doesn't snag... easy to iron if you don't hang straight out of dryer and as an IT guy I can move around squat/bend with comfort and no plumbers crack.",
        "These have never even been in the same room as cotton. These are sooo far from a natural fabric. I can't stress enough that these slacks, if placed near a flame, would burn faster than black powder and leave a toxic puddle on the ground. Good fit though.",

Everything is great except for those. Unlike the rest of the shirt, which is fitted and 100% keeps out the cold, the area from the biceps to the forearms looks billowy and baggy. This is accentuated by the weird visible seam structure. I'd understand if the entire shirt was designed for someone will a bit more mass, but it seems like it was cut for two entirely different body types. If you ever make the arms more streamlined and proportional, please let me know because everything else is excellent, but at this price point I'm sending it back.",

        "I recently purchased the Brady Men's Boxer Brief 5 Pack from Amazon and found them to be comfortable and durable. The fabric is soft and gentle on the skin, providing a pleasant wearing experience. The boxer briefs maintain their shape and elasticity even after multiple wears and washes, thanks to their high-quality construction. The waistband offers a secure fit without digging into the skin. The 5-pack option provides good value for money and comes in a variety of vibrant colors. While the leg openings may be slightly tight for those with larger thighs, overall, these boxer briefs are a reliable choice for everyday wear.",
        "Good boxers, I like that they fit well and keep things in place :)I also appreciate that the branding on the waist band is not overly visible.the boxer are comfortable to wear and the solid colors look good",
        "These briefs are very unique and his most appreciated and liked that he has ever worn. He is a usual boxer wearer and hates boxers with golf pants. I ordered these for use when golfing or wearing golf pants to fix the problem of the boxers bunching up.These briefs are silky smooth very soft cloth material. They are so soft that you will feel them for a bit once you get your hands on them. When he puts them on there is a contoured pouch that holds his club in place over his golf balls. As a side effect they tend to stimulate him a little and he gets excited wearing these, he is a senior and appreciates that fact that he feels so good that they are exciting to him.The briefs are designed quite well to fit the mans body and they also grab his butt and hold it in place protecting it against gravity. He says he feels like he is 40 years younger when wearing these briefs.They are well made, the material is some space age weave of cotton that is with elastic and polyester, it is thicker than expected but not a heat keeper, it still breathes. The manufacturing is quite precise with no issues at all. The waist band has BRADY on it and it is quite imporessive itself, a slighly heavier duty elastic like material than on a typical brief. You definitely feel that these are a luxury briefs and somehow they promote blood flow in the area.",
        "Pros\u2022 Great mix of fabric material\u2022 Comfort & fit\u2022 Quality construction (stitching & support)\u2022 Color selectionCons\u2022 Boxer length for some might be an issue\u2022 PriceVerdict (5 stars)Let\u2019s start with the positives\u2022 Solid build quality, with straight stitching, and the material is elastic and stretches\u2022 The fit and comfort is superb as it has the right blend of fabric types (cotton, polyester, elastane), once on you can barely tell your wearing underwear\u2022 Support is excellent through the crotch providing the right amount of comfort (not to tight or loose), the best part is these don\u2019t ride up while wearing them. You can sit, walk, lay down, and they don\u2019t bunch up in the crotch area\u2022 Sizing is spot onDrawbacks\u2022 No fly front and for those that aren\u2019t used to longer extending boxers briefs it may require an adjustment\u2022 PriceOverallThe biggest barrier for most people with be the price for these boxers. What I can say is the price to value is there as these are quality boxers. Because of the mix of materials these should hold up to wear and washing (many boxers tend to get holes in the crotch area around the seams from rubbing against pants, these should resist that because of the % mix of material specifically the polyester).Once you put them on and wear them you may not want to wear a different pair of boxers again. For me these are my new go to for boxers, when on sale.",
        "Classic case of products starting great but then cheapened over time. Material was perfect in earlier pairs but now it feels cheaper, rougher."
